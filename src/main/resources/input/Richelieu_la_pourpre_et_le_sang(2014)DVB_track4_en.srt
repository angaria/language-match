1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,520
Richelieu: Glory and Blood

2
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,040
Madame!

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
Give back the handkerchief, sir.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,160
I'll do no such thing.

5
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,840
If you are an honorable man,

6
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,280
give me that handkerchief.

7
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,200
My honor is at the point
of my sword, sir.

8
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,920
Removing your sword

9
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,480
in front of Cardinal
de Richelieu's palace is bold!

10
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,120
Don't you know
duels are punished by death?

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,720
Where are you from?

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,840
I cannot reply to your mockery.
The cardinal waits for me.

13
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,440
But I will satisfy you

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,880
and give the disputed object

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,840
to the only person
with any claim to it.

16
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,480
Forgive my boldness, Madame.

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,840
It seems I'm forbidden to keep this.

18
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm devastated.

19
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,280
To whom do I owe the honor?

20
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,640
Henri d'Effiat, Marquis of Cinq-Mars.
At your service, Madame.

21
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,280
I'll remember that.

22
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,440
And I will not forget you.

23
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,000
To the Louvre!

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,440
Tell me, friend,
the name of that lady?

25
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
Marie de Gonzague, sir.

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Duchess of Nevers.

27
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,720
What do I hear, Henri?
You took out your sword?

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,840
Don't you know that dueling
is now a crime against the king?

29
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,080
Forgive me, your Eminence.

30
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,720
A lady's honor was at stake.

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,560
"A lady's honor,"
especially this duchess's,

32
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
is not worth losing your life.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,160
I don't want nobles

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
killing each other over trifles.

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,320
My edicts apply to everyone.

36
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,720
More illustrious names than yours
have paid dearly for such acts.

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,040
I won't forget, your Eminence.

38
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,440
Here is a letter from my mother.

39
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
I don't need to read it.

40
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,320
I can refuse nothing
to the son of my old friend,

41
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
the late Marshal d'Effiat.

42
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,160
Your father was
of great service to the state.

43
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,520
I expect you
to follow the same path.

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,160
That is all I desire, your Eminence.

45
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,800
Fargeau, write a note

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,880
recommending Mr. de Cinq-Mars
to Mr. de Tréville.

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,720
You'll be suited
to the musketeers.

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,880
I know you're brave
and a fine swordsman.

49
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,320
Go prove yourself.

50
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,440
You know my affection for you.

51
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,600
Don't disappoint me!

52
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm at your service,
your Eminence.

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,480
That young man will turn heads.

54
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,960
I'm counting on it.

55
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,720
Why the musketeers instead of
your own guards?

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,280
I have my reasons.

57
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,640
Let's get back to business.

58
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,600
Despite the measures
we have taken,

59
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,760
the queen continues to inform
her brother, King of Spain,

60
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,880
of all the court's goings-on.

61
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,880
I also suspect her
of plotting with Gaston d'Orléans

62
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,600
and trying to harm me personally.

63
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,040
The queen will be furious,
I couldn't convince the cardinal.

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,440
How much longer will she be
locked up in the Louvre?

65
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,640
He won't forgive her letters
to Madrid.

66
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,720
Who denounced her?

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Does the cardinal have a spy?

68
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
He wouldn't dare.

69
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,440
Open your eyes.

70
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,200
His Eminence will do anything
to protect his interests.

71
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,440
Damned cardinal!

72
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,160
I'll be avenged.

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,200
He defies me,
but one day he'll beg me for mercy.

74
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,880
Then I will crush him.

75
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
Your words are unwise.

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,320
Mr. de Thou is right, your Majesty.
Your words may be repeated.

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,040
I know it all too well.

78
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,760
I'm surrounded by spies
trying to ruin me.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,640
They must be uncovered.

80
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,320
Whoever they are!

81
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,960
Let them go tell this false Christian
that his guile makes me sick.

82
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,040
I'm the daughter and sister
of kings, and queen of France!

83
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,360
He will pay for forgetting it.

84
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Well, Monsieur de Cinq-Mars...

85
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
Show what you can do.

86
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,600
Monsieur de Chambord.

87
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,960
He won't last 2 minutes.

88
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,640
Touché, Monsieur!

89
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,120
Monsieur de Beaumont!

90
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,040
Touché, Monsieur!

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Our honor is at stake.

92
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,320
Who is this young officer
fighting off an army?

93
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,040
The Cardinal's protégé.
Marquis of Cinq-Mars.

94
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,480
Touché!

95
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,840
You impressed
Mademoiselle de Hautefort,

96
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
the King's mistress.

97
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,640
Congratulations, sir.

98
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,200
With your sword,
the King is very well-guarded.

99
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,280
With your beauty, Madame,

100
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,920
his Majesty is very well-loved.

101
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,080
I hope to have the pleasure
of seeing you again.

102
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,480
I share your hope, Madame.

103
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,080
To the King, musketeers.

104
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,440
I'll see you later, Mademoiselle.

105
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,000
Come, your Eminence.
I'm late, I know.

106
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,800
Our prey escaped,
but I didn't want to give up.

107
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,640
Your Majesty.

108
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,280
3 hours of hunting for nothing.
That beast was clever.

109
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,800
Maybe it knew we were coming.

110
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,920
I must speak to you
before the council.

111
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,800
New trouble has broken out
in Berry, Champagne, and Poitou.

112
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
The cities are rebelling
against our intendants,

113
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,360
the peasants are stirred up.

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,800
In Paris, attempts on my life
are rumored.

115
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
This isn't new. You are easy to hate.

116
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,200
I only govern,
but France is not an easy child.

117
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,720
It rebels against each edict
and rejects reform.

118
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,160
By God! That isn't new either.

119
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Govern, my dear minister.
You have my trust.

120
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,200
Your enemies are my enemies.

121
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,360
Protect yourself as needed.

122
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,080
Haven't I given you guards?

123
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,920
Yes, Sire.

124
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,800
Not to mention the spies

125
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,080
you have all over
France and Navarre.

126
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,800
Take off this vest, La Chesnaie!

127
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,520
It's too tight.

128
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,640
Don't give me these garish colors.
You know I like moderation.

129
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm worried by the loss
of Mr. de Comons,

130
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,080
my dresser.

131
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,240
He was so wise.

132
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,800
Who at the court
can take on this duty?

133
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,080
The Marquis de Cinq-Mars, Sire.

134
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,920
Henri d'Effiat has taste and wit.

135
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,520
Is he related to
the Marshal d'Effiat

136
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,080
who served us so well?

137
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,520
He's his son, your Majesty.
Ready to serve you like his father.

138
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,800
Really?

139
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,520
Well, let's see!

140
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,360
As always,
I trust your good feelings for me.

141
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,640
Places, gentlemen. The King arrives.

142
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,520
Henri! Henri, come.

143
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,760
Let me introduce you to his Majesty.

144
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,240
Let me introduce you to
the young man I spoke of.

145
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,800
Henri d'Effiat, Marquis de Cinq-Mars.

146
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,960
Stand up, Monsieur.

147
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,520
Glad to meet the son
of our friend the Marshal.

148
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,080
His memory is dear.
We owe him a great deal.

149
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,400
I owe him just as much.

150
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,800
And I'll serve you as eagerly,
if you'll give me the chance.

151
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,040
We'll give it to you. Certainly.

152
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,960
I like your idea, your Eminence.

153
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,960
This young marquis speaks
openly and honestly.

154
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,760
Congratulations, your Majesty.

155
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,360
Your decisions at the council
were very wise.

156
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,240
Isn't he a bit young
for this position?

157
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,080
On the contrary, Sire.

158
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,360
You need new blood.

159
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,400
He's a proud horseman

160
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,680
with whom I'll enjoy hunting.

161
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,960
One more thing, Sire,
if you'll allow.

162
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,800
Well?

163
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm worried about
your brother's intentions.

164
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,320
My spies tell me he's in Paris

165
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,680
although we banned him from the city.

166
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,240
You won't deny that Gaston d'Orléans
plots against us?

167
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,240
My brother is a scatterbrain
who wants the throne.

168
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,800
But who cares,
since your spies watch him?

169
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,280
There's way to crush
his claim to the throne.

170
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,960
And what is that?

171
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,080
Give an heir to France.

172
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,840
It's not for lack of trying.

173
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,800
Can I help it if the queen
is not fertile soil?

174
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,680
And I've lost interest in trying.

175
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,760
Your Highness!

176
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,560
You're late.

177
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,360
Well! Will the cardinal
see his mistress tonight?

178
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,960
She told me so.

179
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,400
Marion De Lorme
will receive no one else.

180
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,000
His Eminence will use a carriage

181
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,520
with no crest or escort.

182
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,840
His discretion will be his ruin.

183
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
The cardinal is yours.

184
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,120
If your assassins are successful,
your fortune is made.

185
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,960
He's a dead man, your Highness.

186
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,120
Well, Madame!

187
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
What news?

188
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Good news.
The storm washed out the road.

189
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,000
The king will spend
the night at the Louvre.

190
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,120
His Majesty will share
the queen's bed.

191
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank heaven and pray

192
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,720
that we'll soon have an heir.

193
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
What else?

194
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
The king was in a very good mood

195
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,560
about his new dresser.

196
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,440
A certain Marquis de Cinq-Mars
that no one's heard of.

197
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,440
You'll hear of him soon.

198
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,400
Did you see the Spanish ambassador
with the queen recently?

199
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,800
The Marquis de Mirabel came
to see her yesterday at nightfall.

200
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,440
I brought him to her study.

201
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,720
They stayed there
for almost an hour.

202
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,120
I checked this morning.

203
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,080
The letters that his Majesty had
written to his brother weren't there.

204
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,560
Thank you for your precious aid.

205
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,360
Go back to the Louvre

206
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,880
and I'll take care of your interests
as you take care of mine.

207
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,520
- All is ready, your Eminence.
- Perfect.

208
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,440
Take them alive.

209
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,160
So they tell us
everything they know.

210
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't kill him! No!

211
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,680
I wanted him alive!

212
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,680
I want prisoners!

213
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,440
No! Don't kill him!

214
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,960
Don't kill him!
Don't kill him!

215
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,160
Viva Espana!

216
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
The Devil take it!

217
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
I wanted them alive!

218
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,680
I needed them to name

219
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,120
Gaston d'Orléans
and his co-conspirators.

220
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,000
How can I prove his betrayal
to the king?

221
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,160
How can I know if the queen
was part of this plot?

222
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,960
Where can they be?

223
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,720
We should've already heard.

224
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,600
Calm down, your Highness.
You'll make me doubt you.

225
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,240
Do you know what I found out?

226
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,240
The king is sleeping
with the queen tonight.

227
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,680
Who cares!

228
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,160
He won't impregnate her
after 22 years of childlessness.

229
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
Flee, it failed.

230
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,440
- Impossible.
- The cardinal was warned.

231
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,280
His men were everywhere.

232
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,880
I'm ruined.

233
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,960
- Do they have prisoners?
- No.

234
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,320
None survived.

235
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,960
Goodbye, Marie. Goodbye.
I'm leaving for Lorraine.

236
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,880
Stay!

237
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,040
You're safe
with the queen's confessor.

238
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,480
We must kill the cardinal.

239
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,840
- How? He's the devil.
- We can't give up.

240
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,680
Stay! The queen will help us.

241
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
I must speak to his Eminence.

242
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
What's going on?

243
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,040
Is it true?

244
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
His Majesty wants me to dress him?

245
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,120
It's true, congratulations.

246
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400
Why congratulations?

247
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,160
I was born to serve with my sword.

248
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,560
Do you know how many soldiers,
counts, and barons would be honored

249
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,160
by this position?

250
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,600
With all due respect,

251
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
I have no interest
in the king's trousers.

252
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,480
I want to be useful.

253
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,480
And I want you to obey.
The king wants it,

254
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,480
and that's enough.

255
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,560
Haven't I always helped you, my boy?

256
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,680
Didn't I get you a spot
in the military academy?

257
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,320
Haven't I, since your father's death,

258
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,680
advised your mother

259
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,680
on raising you?

260
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,320
Of course.

261
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,600
Then trust me,

262
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
and be glad to see
the most powerful

263
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,480
man in the kingdom every day.

264
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,480
He makes and breaks
men's destinies.

265
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,280
If he likes you,

266
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,760
your fortune is made.

267
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,760
I'm offering you more than a career.

268
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,880
A destiny.

269
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,040
You'll serve me well near the king.

270
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,680
How so?

271
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
We're at war, Henri.

272
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,040
Spanish forces threaten
our borders, in Flanders

273
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,400
and in the south, in Roussillon.

274
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,840
Will we let the king of Spain
invade the kingdom,

275
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
on the pretext that his sister,
queen of France, and the Pope in Rome

276
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,840
consider Philip IV of Spain
more Catholic than us?

277
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,320
- No. Of course not.
- Then we agree.

278
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,600
Now it happens that...

279
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,200
the king is smitten with
Mademoiselle de Hautefort.

280
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,840
Very pious like him,

281
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,160
she criticizes my alliances

282
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,160
with the protestant states
of Sweden and Holland.

283
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,760
Well,

284
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,160
I expect you

285
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,680
to get rid of
this harmful woman for me.

286
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,760
How? You think
I'm more powerful than I am.

287
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,040
You're wrong there, Henri.

288
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,480
You're clever and attractive.

289
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,000
That's what the king likes.

290
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,840
You don't think he'll wear this?

291
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,280
Why not?

292
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,040
The king only wears black,
or gray on New Year's Eve.

293
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,920
He'll give up this austerity.

294
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,920
He's not a protestant
as far as I know.

295
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,880
Oh, my Lord!
You speak of the king, sir.

296
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,920
Really?

297
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,040
Well, hello, Monsieur de Cinq-Mars.

298
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,040
Well! Where is my suit?

299
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,360
Here, Sire.

300
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,520
Are you joking, sir?

301
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,240
What's this gold, these frills?

302
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,320
Do you think I'm a marquis
trying to be fashionable?

303
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,120
I think
you're the greatest of monarchs,

304
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,600
the king of France,
who must impress.

305
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
You're judging me, Marquis?

306
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,560
I'm saying, Sire,

307
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,000
that the world will judge you
by your clothes.

308
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,040
You are France.

309
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,720
Your subjects expect
you to represent them

310
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,560
with the splendor
and magnificence they deserve.

311
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,040
They'll be proud
to see you in something

312
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,040
elegant and worthy
of the power you embody.

313
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,120
I forgive your insolence,
as youth is your excuse.

314
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,160
But it's not my nature
to be ostentatious.

315
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,840
"Don't judge a book by its cover,"
sir.

316
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,760
My power is not in my clothes.

317
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,400
Don't expect me to wear this outfit.

318
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,880
His Majesty the King.

319
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,600
Your Majesty,

320
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,560
France has never been
so brilliantly represented.

321
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,120
Light has arrived with you, Sire.

322
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,200
Well, Madame!
You say nothing?

323
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,480
There would be too much to say, Sire.

324
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,480
Congratulations, Henri.

325
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,040
François!

326
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,320
My friend.

327
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,920
What joy to see you again.

328
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,200
What is this masquerade?

329
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,720
You're the laughingstock
of the Court.

330
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,480
Will you pray in this outfit?

331
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,720
Have you forgotten
to whom you speak, Madame?

332
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
It befits the king of France

333
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,560
to appear in all the splendor
of his power.

334
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
I expect you to remember that.

335
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,160
Sire, this isn't like you.

336
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,880
This Marquis de Cinq-Mars
is making you ridiculous.

337
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,920
A man beholden to Richelieu!

338
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,120
Be quiet!

339
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,120
Not another word.

340
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,320
The Marquis de Cinq-Mars
has my full confidence.

341
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,280
Treat him with respect!

342
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,880
I don't recognize you, Sire.

343
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,000
You've always scorned
the vanity of the world.

344
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,280
Where's the man I love
who fears the Lord?

345
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,760
That man has long been
too indulgent with you.

346
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,200
He is annoyed with your manners
and asks you to change them.

347
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,360
Alas, your Majesty!
I cannot share

348
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,640
your favors
with that fop you're infatuated with.

349
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,480
That's enough!

350
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,080
Since you do not share
my affections, leave the Court.

351
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,480
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

352
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,600
Farewell!

353
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,160
And get married!
I'll give you 1,000 crowns.

354
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,360
Well, sir!

355
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,560
Your star is rising quickly.

356
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,280
Be careful or the sun will burn you.

357
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,040
There is no sun here but you.

358
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,440
Your sparkling eyes alone
endanger a heart that burns for you.

359
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,560
That is very chivalrous, sir.

360
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
And you are very convincing.

361
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,480
You showed it
by turning the king into a sovereign.

362
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,640
His Majesty the King!

363
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,800
Stay with me, Marquis.

364
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,080
Leave the women
and let's be friends.

365
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
First, I'll teach you
the customs of the Court.

366
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,200
No need, Sire.

367
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,920
The king determines the customs
and I'm honored by your friendship.

368
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,320
You have an answer for everything.

369
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,280
I like that.

370
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,800
I won't get bored with you.

371
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,360
Leave, ladies.

372
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,000
Leave!

373
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,080
If Mademoiselle de Hautefort
is out of favor,

374
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,520
we've lost a friend to our cause.

375
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,920
It's a victory for the cardinal.

376
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,720
Certainly, your Majesty.

377
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
But I have an idea.

378
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,920
If the king is friends
with this Marquis,

379
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,920
let's have him join our cause.

380
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,800
That will be difficult, your Majesty.

381
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,520
He is the cardinal's protégé,
and son of the Marshal d'Effiat.

382
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,080
Oh, yes!

383
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,040
That's true.

384
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,200
But I hear he's young
with charming manners.

385
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,360
He may be charmed by you.

386
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,360
Come on, Duchess!

387
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,200
The idea appeals to you.

388
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,760
Why not try it?

389
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,080
Your weapons are much more powerful
than those of Mr. de Richelieu.

390
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,240
Your Majesty,
Monsieur de Thou is here

391
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,920
with the Marquis de Cinq-Mars

392
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,360
whom he'd like you to meet.

393
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Perfect timing.

394
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,320
Bring in the gentlemen,
Mademoiselle.

395
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,200
What a nice surprise!

396
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,080
Thank you for seeing us,
your Majesty.

397
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
I'd like to introduce my friend,

398
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,600
Marquis de Cinq-Mars,

399
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,360
who is in charge
of the king's wardrobe.

400
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,880
Here's the man all Paris
is talking about.

401
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,520
I'm charmed, Monsieur.

402
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,520
It's a huge privilege,
your Majesty.

403
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,080
I'm at your feet.

404
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,320
What do you think, Duchess?

405
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,080
He's the most handsome man.

406
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,520
Don't compliment him too much,
your Majesty.

407
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,960
He might get the wrong idea.

408
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,240
Mademoiselle de Hautefort
is disgraced?

409
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,800
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely, your Eminence.

410
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,080
The king has been charmed
by the Marquis

411
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,520
and wants him to follow him
everywhere.

412
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,440
That's better than I hoped, Chavigny.

413
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,240
Cinq-Mars is even better
than I thought.

414
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,080
It was a brilliant idea,
your Eminence.

415
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,440
As long as Mr. de Cinq-Mars is loyal.

416
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,640
What do you mean?

417
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,800
He was welcomed by Mr. de Thou,
the queen's devoted advisor.

418
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,680
They're childhood friends.
Where's the harm?

419
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,960
I also saw him courting
the Duchess de Nevers.

420
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,880
Henri is too smart
to be snared by her.

421
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,080
And at 30,
the ex-mistress of Gaston d'Orléans

422
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,880
is not a threat.

423
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm not sure.

424
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,080
She's already shown
her boundless ambition.

425
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,520
I tell you she won't corrupt
Henri d'Effiat.

426
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,920
What's happening?

427
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,600
Did his Holiness Urban VIII
breathe his last?

428
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,800
Your Eminence, it's a miracle.

429
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
The queen is pregnant.

430
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,680
The queen is pregnant!

431
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,400
About time!

432
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,680
Let's pray she'll give
the king an heir.

433
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,400
The queen is pregnant!
The queen is pregnant!

434
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320
Your Majesty.

435
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,440
Did your quarry escape?

436
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,800
A deadly dull hunt.

437
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,080
- Where is Mr. de Cinq-Mars?
- In Paris, Sire.

438
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,760
What? What's he doing there?

439
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,960
Doesn't he know he's in my service
and I must change after hunting?

440
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,160
I want to see him.

441
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,760
Go find him, right now!

442
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,120
Monsieur de Tréville!

443
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,400
I don't know why
I yielded to you, Monsieur.

444
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,320
Curiosity, I suppose.

445
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,880
"Curiosity," Madame?

446
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,280
Yes.

447
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,640
I admit you intrigue me.

448
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,160
I'd like to know
how you charmed the king.

449
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,560
In the same way
you've charmed me, Madame.

450
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,440
I loved you at 1st sight.
My heart beats only for you.

451
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,960
Please, sir.
Get up and be reasonable.

452
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,240
What do you hope for?

453
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,160
That you'll love me as I love you.

454
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,040
My God! Only that?

455
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,280
I'm moved, I admit. But...

456
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,040
Monsieur de Cinq-Mars!

457
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,800
What is it?

458
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,400
I have orders to bring you back.

459
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,320
What does he want now?

460
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,400
The king's orders aren't questioned.

461
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,600
Go!

462
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,680
Don't make his Majesty wait.

463
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,000
When will I see you again?

464
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,320
That wouldn't be wise.

465
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,840
I don't want to be wise. When?

466
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,720
Tonight. I'll be waiting.

467
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,320
That's an eternity.

468
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,400
Don't forget that I love you.

469
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,880
Well, Monsieur de Cinq-Mars!

470
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,520
Is this how you serve me?

471
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,040
Didn't I say
you should never leave me?

472
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,560
What do say you to that?

473
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,160
I thought you were hunting, Sire.

474
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,760
And that I should greet the queen.

475
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,120
She doesn't need your greetings.

476
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,400
You're mine.

477
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,000
I want you to stay at my side.

478
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,720
The truth, sir.
Whom were you seeing?

479
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,320
No!

480
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,560
Don't tell me.

481
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,680
It was a woman.

482
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,600
What woman could resist
this angelic face?

483
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,480
Don't compromise yourself
with one of those marquises

484
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,560
looking for a mate.

485
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,320
That's not my intention, Sire.

486
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,760
My ambition is to serve you,
rest assured.

487
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,480
Well!

488
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,280
How do I look?

489
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,600
Handsome as Apollo, Sire.

490
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,400
To Mr. de Richelieu,
who brought you to me.

491
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,760
To Mr. de Richelieu,
who has let me serve you.

492
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,120
Come, now!

493
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,440
Don't speak of serving me,
I want us to be friends.

494
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,840
Open your heart to me.
I'll do the same.

495
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,120
My heart is yours, Sire.

496
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,000
Is it true that you sent
Miss de Hautefort away?

497
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,000
There's much gossip here.

498
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,000
Don't believe it.

499
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,840
You were just an excuse.

500
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,640
She had irritated me
by criticizing the cardinal.

501
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,920
She used our time praying

502
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,720
to be the voice of
the queen and the Pope.

503
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,280
It takes a low opinion of the king

504
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,560
to think the cardinal's policy
is not approved by me.

505
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,000
Good night, Henri.

506
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,280
I had a nice evening.

507
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,160
Good night, Sire.

508
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,480
Every moment with you is glorious.

509
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,040
I'm eager to see you tomorrow.

510
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,920
You've taken a great risk, Marquis.

511
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,360
Is it worth it?

512
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,480
If necessary, I would've sacrificed
my life to see you.

513
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,160
I don't have enough words
to express my love.

514
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,920
This is too much.
Your passion scares me.

515
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,560
You are clever and
the king loves you.

516
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,880
It would be mad
to compromise your position.

517
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,200
What does the king matter
if you love me?

518
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,000
Say the word
and I'll marry you, Madame.

519
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,920
My God! Then I would be
unreasonable.

520
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,720
Do you know the difference
in our positions?

521
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,920
You're a marquis.

522
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,000
But I'm a sovereign duchess.

523
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,280
The king will not consent.

524
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,440
The king will ignore it
because he loves me.

525
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,040
The king will have you killed
because he loves you.

526
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,440
Is there no way?

527
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,160
There's a way to reduce
the distance between us.

528
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,760
Really? Speak.

529
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,320
Do you remember the falconer
whom the king loved so much?

530
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,600
Well?

531
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,600
Didn't the king make him duke
and Lord Chancellor?

532
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,360
You could reach such heights.

533
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,040
Then you could claim my hand.

534
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,360
You've brought me back to life,
Madame.

535
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,080
What is this play with 3 duels,
Mr. Corneille?

536
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,880
This is scandalous.

537
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,880
That's not my intention.
But The Cid required them.

538
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,200
I require you to rewrite it.

539
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,000
I didn't give you 1,500 pounds
to copy a Spanish play.

540
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,080
I was just inspired by an event.

541
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,440
Indeed! We're at war with Spain.

542
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,920
It's not the time to boast
of an enemy's exploits.

543
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,720
But your niece liked it very much.

544
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,040
I know. It was clever
to dedicate it to her.

545
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,760
Take this down: "I forbid
the play The Cid

546
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,040
"to be performed again...

547
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,720
"until the Academy
has given its opinion."

548
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,880
Go, sir!

549
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,880
My deep respect, your Eminence.

550
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,600
Wait!

551
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,880
Here.

552
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,160
It's another comedy of mine

553
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,440
that you can develop as you like.

554
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,920
Just improve it

555
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,640
without changing the plot, please.

556
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,400
His play has ideas
that offend the state.

557
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,320
See that the Academy rejects it.

558
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,160
We must leave, your Eminence.
You'll be late for the council.

559
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,440
Dismounting!

560
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,840
Your Eminence!

561
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,400
Your Eminence, I must speak to you.

562
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,920
Just a word, please.

563
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,400
I'm in a hurry, Henri.

564
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,200
And I don't like the way
you show up like this.

565
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,200
I'm sorry, but it's important.

566
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,320
Come with me,
tell me on the way.

567
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,440
Are you mad?

568
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,560
I'm completely against it, Henri.

569
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,160
I'll never agree to it.

570
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,600
Nor will the king, or anyone else.

571
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,720
So Chavigny was right.

572
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,560
You've given in to the evil
charms of that conniving woman.

573
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,320
Is it possible
to be so blinded by passion?

574
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,120
This woman manipulates you, Henri,
and mocks you.

575
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,720
She has but one goal:

576
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,040
using you to hurt me.

577
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,480
Why else would she agree
to marry beneath her?

578
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,560
You will not plead my cause?

579
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,160
Never!

580
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,760
Don't say a word to his Majesty.

581
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,600
You're just a simple gentleman
elevated by me,

582
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,440
you exist only through me.

583
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,080
I order you to forget her
and devote yourself

584
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
to your mission: serving me.

585
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,640
You'll pay for this,
Monsieur de Richelieu.

586
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,720
The ingrate threatens me!

587
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,520
What have you done by introducing
me to the Marquis de Cinq-Mars?

588
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,600
I wanted only your happiness,
Sire.

589
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,440
Does the devil hide
behind his beauty?

590
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,600
He's afraid of nothing.

591
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,480
His insolence has no limits,

592
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,280
he's unaware of the respect
due a king.

593
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,440
You'll soon forget him, Sire.

594
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,480
Our armies must attack.

595
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,000
Portugal has risen up
against Madrid.

596
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,800
The Catalan ambassadors
are in Paris and ask you

597
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,160
to liberate their province.

598
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,440
I must congratulate you, sir.

599
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,200
Your patience has borne fruit.

600
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,240
I'll lead this expedition.

601
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,080
We'll push Spain back
across the Pyrenees.

602
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,600
I'll forget the disappointments
of Mr. de Cinq-Mars,

603
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,320
who is never where I seek him.

604
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,800
He's impulsive, but completely
devoted to you, your Majesty.

605
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,720
Don't refuse him your favor.

606
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,440
He takes advantage of my favor.

607
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,880
He takes advantage.

608
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,440
Monsieur de Cinq-Mars!

609
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,320
His Majesty has been looking
for you for hours.

610
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,320
- He's in a bad mood.
- That's not your concern.

611
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,240
Your horse!

612
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,240
Never mind. Here's his Majesty.

613
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,440
Leave us!

614
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,760
What is going on?

615
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,880
You're remiss in your duties.
I cannot put up with it.

616
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,680
Mr. de La Chesnaie told me
you ran off to the duchess.

617
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,600
She was my brother's mistress.
Is it true?

618
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,600
Yes, your Majesty. Are you going
to preach like Mr. de Richelieu?

619
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,880
What do I care
what the cardinal said!

620
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,880
Here's what the king says.

621
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,240
Give up this woman.

622
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,440
You'll gain honor

623
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,880
and not be drawn into
dastardly plots.

624
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,880
Can't I serve you and love her?

625
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,400
I won't tolerate it.

626
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,880
I don't want her to destroy you.
Forget her.

627
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,320
To console you,
if you promise to break it off,

628
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,960
I'll give you 1,500 crowns
and make you First Squire.

629
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,400
What do you say?

630
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,920
As Wardrobe Master,
this duty does not raise my status.

631
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,400
Then what will satisfy you?

632
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,600
Make me Grand Squire,
your Majesty.

633
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,760
Aren't I the son
of a marshal of France?

634
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,760
That is one of the most
prestigious titles, Henri.

635
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,840
Many illustrious men seek it.

636
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,920
But I'll grant it to you.

637
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,320
Be worthy of it.

638
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,640
I'll ride with you to Perpignan
which we'll besiege

639
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,760
together to take
Roussillon from the Spanish.

640
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,120
I'll fight to the death
beside you, Sire.

641
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,640
So I swear before God.

642
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,320
Stand up,

643
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,760
Grand Squire,

644
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,040
it's not about dying, but living.

645
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,760
Alive or dead, I'm yours, Sire.

646
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,320
And I give you my heart.

647
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,200
And I promise
no other will share it.

648
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,760
Well! What is it?

649
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,040
Be glad.

650
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,560
We will soon be joined
by the sacred bonds of marriage.

651
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,200
The king made me
his Grand Squire.

652
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,760
Tomorrow, I'll be a duke
and a French peer.

653
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,360
Congratulations, Grand Squire.

654
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,040
The king must love you.

655
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,320
Perhaps he'll make you
duke and supreme commander.

656
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,040
You forget the man
who won't let us marry.

657
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,040
I know, the cardinal.

658
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,120
He refused. He hates you
as much as you hate him.

659
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,200
I hate him
because he is ruining France.

660
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,920
Because he's made the king
his servant,

661
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,360
because he attacks the queen
and kills good Christians.

662
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,640
He has blood on his hands.

663
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,040
- We must stop him.
- How? The king trusts him.

664
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,360
But the king loves you.

665
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,360
You can tell him
the cardinal spies on him

666
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,840
and makes him a puppet.

667
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,720
He must know
who really controls the country.

668
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,560
Did I hear you right, Madame?

669
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,920
You ask me to betray
the man who helped me

670
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,920
and gave me the chance to meet you?

671
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,920
What loyalty do you owe
a man who forbids you to love?

672
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,080
Will we never be happy?

673
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,200
Must he tyrannize us
as he tyrannizes France?

674
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,360
The cardinal is using you, Henri.

675
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,480
You're just a pawn in his game.

676
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,640
And your happiness will last
only if you serve his plans.

677
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,560
Believe me.

678
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,160
By fighting him,
you'll avoid inevitable disgrace.

679
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,720
It's doomed to fail.

680
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,080
The king's faith in
the cardinal can't be shaken.

681
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,640
Then we must take other action.

682
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,000
How?

683
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,440
Do you love me, Henri?

684
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,640
Can you doubt it?

685
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,160
I love you too.

686
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,080
And in love,
the means do not matter.

687
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,080
Hurry!

688
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,240
The time has come, my friends.

689
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,080
The king leaves Paris tomorrow
with the army,

690
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,360
leaving the cardinal
to his dirty dealings.

691
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,360
This time, we won't fail.

692
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,160
The cardinal must not know...

693
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,960
I bring you a man
who is on our side, gentlemen.

694
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,480
You put us in great danger, Madame.

695
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,080
It's madness to bring
the cardinal's creature here.

696
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,640
He works for Richelieu.

697
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,920
Do you doubt my word?

698
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,240
That's enough.
Put away your swords.

699
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,720
I vouch for Mr. de Cinq-Mars.

700
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,520
It's true that the cardinal
aided in my happy destiny,

701
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,240
but he has asked for
too much in return.

702
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,080
I refused to spy on the king

703
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,360
and his ways disgust me.

704
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,240
I see that there is
too much blood spilled,

705
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,960
too many taxes,
and too much poverty.

706
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,240
Welcome, Grand Squire.

707
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,520
What do you think of
a pension of 40,000 crowns

708
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,080
from his Majesty Philip IV of Spain?

709
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,080
I think it sounds very good.

710
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,080
Consider it done.

711
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,520
I knew you'd join us.

712
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,520
Here's where things stand.

713
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,360
Fontrailles will leave
tonight for Madrid

714
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,680
with our treaty offer
for the king, stating that,

715
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,200
when the cardinal's death
is announced,

716
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,920
9,000 horsemen in Roussillon
will invade the kingdom

717
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,960
at my orders.

718
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,080
This is agreed by her Majesty
Queen Anne of Austria.

719
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,680
Don't speak the queen's name.

720
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,040
He's right.

721
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,200
The queen must never be
implicated in our actions.

722
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,880
Have no fear.

723
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,240
No one will leave
without swearing an oath.

724
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,680
Your swords, gentlemen.

725
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,520
Swear by the Holy Virgin

726
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,520
to always keep our plot secret

727
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,680
and never reveal our names

728
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,200
or that of the queen.

729
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,800
I swear!

730
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,040
If it's true that Cinq-Mars
has joined my enemies,

731
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,520
he'll pay for this betrayal.

732
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,600
- Should we arrest them?
- No.

733
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,360
I want to know what they're plotting
and catch them in the act.

734
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,320
How many are there?

735
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,680
About a dozen.

736
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,760
I recognize the queen's advisor.

737
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,760
He'll pay for it with his life.

738
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,840
For now, watch them
and keep me informed.

739
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,320
Your Eminence.

740
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,840
I never should've brought Henri
d'Effiat into the king's service.

741
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,480
I acted upon foolish emotion.

742
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,680
In politics,
you can't trust your feelings.

743
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,400
Wait before blaming him.

744
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,520
Perhaps he's working for us.

745
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,760
No. He's betrayed me, I know it.

746
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,120
And yet you warned me.

747
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,240
How could I imagine
he'd fall in love

748
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,680
with Marie de Gonzague?

749
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,240
My worst enemy.

750
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,080
He's in her power.

751
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,360
And Henri isn't Rodrigue.

752
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,920
His passion defeats his honor
and he'll betray me.

753
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,920
I can't believe it.

754
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,840
Your Eminence.

755
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,040
Your Eminence!

756
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,240
The viscount de Fontrailles was seen
in Orléans, disguised as a monk.

757
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,640
He's going to Spain.

758
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,680
How do you know?

759
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,840
His squire.

760
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,400
- He spoke but will speak no more.
- Very good.

761
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,960
Is Mr. d'Orléans still hiding
at Saint-Sulpice Abbey?

762
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,080
He hasn't left, your Eminence.

763
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,400
Let him stay there!

764
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,480
He can't pray enough
to save his soul.

765
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,760
Watch him.

766
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,080
My lord.

767
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,920
If Gaston d'Orléans' damned soul
runs to Madrid,

768
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,400
it's to tell our enemies
of our plans.

769
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,840
Places, gentlemen.
His Majesty arrives.

770
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,200
Well, Grand Squire!
What do you want?

771
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,400
His Majesty asked me
to attend the council, your Eminence.

772
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,680
You don't belong here,
Grand Squire.

773
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,920
Withdraw.

774
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,360
But the king...

775
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,000
I order you to leave, little marquis!

776
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,080
My orders suffice.

777
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,640
This is not the king's council,
it's a war council.

778
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,400
You're not an army officer
as far as I know.

779
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,680
War is not your concern.

780
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,240
For the last time,

781
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,240
leave this place immediately.

782
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,560
Where are you going?

783
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,560
Isn't it time for the council?

784
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,560
What's wrong?

785
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,280
You're so pale...

786
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,640
It's painful for me
to refuse you, Sire.

787
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,160
I wouldn't help you

788
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,400
by meeting with the captains
who lead your armies.

789
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,520
I don't have their knowledge
or experience of war.

790
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,560
I recognize
your pure and loyal heart.

791
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,360
We'll gather our troops here,
in Narbonne,

792
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,960
before entering Roussillon
at his Majesty's orders.

793
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,720
Go on, Monsieur de Richelieu.

794
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,000
I invited the Grand Squire,
but he thought himself unworthy.

795
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,280
We should praise his wisdom
and discernment.

796
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,640
I will tell him.

797
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,240
Well! How does our expedition look?

798
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,160
Very good, Sire.

799
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,440
Our forces are stronger.

800
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,440
The Duke d'Olivares
holds the fort of Rivesaltes

801
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,120
that we must take
before reaching Perpignan.

802
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,840
That could cause heavy losses.

803
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,360
Couldn't we count on some turncoats?

804
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,280
If we give pensions
to some townspeople,

805
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,240
they'll open the gates.

806
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,400
You read my mind, your Majesty.

807
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,280
My agents are working on it.

808
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,240
Gentlemen,

809
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,560
The French crown has an heir.

810
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,280
Long live Louis,

811
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,280
dauphin of France.

812
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,840
Long live Louis,

813
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,560
dauphin of France.

814
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,160
Marie!

815
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,720
Marie! It's decided.
I'll kill the cardinal myself.

816
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,560
Quiet. Do you want to go
to the Bastille?

817
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,600
- What fury!
- You will hear of it.

818
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,160
From rumors, alas.

819
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,120
I swear it.
He'll pay for insulting me.

820
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,720
Calm down!

821
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,880
No. I don't want calm,
I want revenge.

822
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,120
Not so rash.

823
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,320
The king loves you,
have him banish the cardinal.

824
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,880
Or better yet:
get his blessing to kill him.

825
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,440
Blessing or no blessing,
Richelieu will die.

826
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,600
I leave with his Majesty
for Narbonne.

827
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,720
I'll wait for the cardinal and do it.

828
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,040
Let his Highness know.

829
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,520
I fear for you, Henri.

830
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,720
Let the assassins
of the king of Spain do it.

831
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,600
You don't understand, Marie.

832
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,960
Not satisfied with
refusing our marriage,

833
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,560
Mr. de Richelieu besmirched my name
in front of the lords.

834
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,440
I won't be worthy of you
until I've killed him.

835
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,160
May God protect you!

836
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,880
If you succeed, Henri,
a great destiny awaits you.

837
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:16,000
Awaits us, Marie.
Never doubt my love.

838
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,160
I miss you already.

839
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,440
Come back safe and sound.

840
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,000
I can't take it anymore.

841
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,440
My legs are stiff as logs.

842
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,240
A 5-hour ride!

843
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,600
At this rate,
we'll be there in 1 week.

844
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
When does the cardinal leave Paris?

845
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
Tomorrow morning.

846
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,480
His rheumatism makes him
break up the trip.

847
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,880
He'll sleep here tomorrow,
at the mayor's,

848
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,880
inside the city walls.

849
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,240
Isn't he too old
to manage the government?

850
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,480
What do you mean?

851
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,160
You gave him this position
18 years ago.

852
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,160
Aren't you tired of these rebellions?
Of the blood he spills

853
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,960
for his own glory?

854
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,600
Such talk could land you
in the Bastille,

855
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,600
Henri.

856
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,280
I love you, so I speak my mind.

857
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,160
I'm not one of those flatterers
who talk behind your back.

858
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,000
That's true.
That's why I love and forgive you.

859
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,280
I know my prime minister's flaws
better than anyone.

860
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,880
I know his love
of the money he's amassed.

861
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,480
I know his vain pretentions
to write plays.

862
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,960
It's amusing to see him enraged
at Corneille's success

863
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,000
while he has The Cid banned
by his Academy out of jealousy.

864
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,720
I laugh at his ambition to build

865
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,680
an ideal city
named after himself:

866
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,480
Richelieu.

867
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,880
He prefers matters of state
to those of the church

868
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,760
and skips saying mass

869
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,440
to go see his mistresses,
the most beautiful women in Paris.

870
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,560
What is there to add?

871
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,040
That he likes shedding blood.

872
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,280
and cutting off the heads
of great nobles.

873
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,840
And killing your soldiers
on the battlefield,

874
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,880
and massacring your peasants
who rebel against poverty.

875
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,520
What is there to add?

876
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,160
That he likes spying
on everyone for better control.

877
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,240
Starting with his king.

878
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,160
The cardinal spies on me?

879
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,800
Your valet, Mr. de La Chesnaie,
goes to his palace on Tuesdays

880
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,960
to tell him
all your words and actions.

881
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,840
If that's true, his Eminence
must explain himself.

882
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,360
But have you by any chance
become his enemy?

883
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,400
Can't I both criticize
and love him, Sire?

884
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,120
Be careful.

885
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,840
Attacking him means attacking me.

886
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,240
You don't know what ruling
France is like.

887
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,800
The kingdom consists
of many peoples:

888
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,440
Normans, Bretons, Basques,

889
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,160
Burgundians, Picards, Provençals...

890
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,080
Making them agree to
a common destiny called France

891
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,880
and putting them under
a single authority:

892
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,680
that's the cardinal's ultimate plan.

893
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,560
Why give him so much power?

894
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,560
Aren't you the king?

895
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,400
With such an intelligent

896
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,880
man who wants France's glory
in my service,

897
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,000
I must step back, Henri.

898
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,560
But nothing is done
without my agreement.

899
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,000
The cardinal tells me what he does
every day.

900
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,280
We decide together.

901
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,840
And because of his good judgment
and trust in you

902
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,720
I can open my heart to you
without fear.

903
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,720
It's shameful!

904
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,440
How can a cardinal
make alliances with heretics

905
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,760
to fight my brother,

906
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,320
the very Catholic king?

907
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:22,760
Mr. de Richelieu's only religion
is serving the state.

908
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,400
Your Majesty, the Marquis de Mirabel

909
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,320
is here and would like to see you.

910
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,280
Show him in and leave us,
please.

911
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,040
Antonio. What news?

912
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,000
Here's the treaty
signed by the king, your brother,

913
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,840
your Majesty.

914
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,560
You and Gaston d'Orléans alone
have a copy.

915
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,000
Does he accept our conditions?

916
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,000
All of them, your Majesty.

917
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,760
God is with us.

918
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,280
Only one thing is lacking.

919
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,440
What is it?

920
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,960
The cardinal's death.

921
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,280
Have you lost your head,
Mademoiselle?

922
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,040
Coming here in the daytime.

923
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,200
Something is going on.

924
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,040
The queen has been agitated
for days.

925
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,480
She can't sleep
and is easily irritated.

926
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,040
You want to tell me
of the queen's moods?

927
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,120
That's not all.

928
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,760
Yesterday, the Marquis de Mirabel
came to see her.

929
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,880
Later that night,

930
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,880
her Majesty wouldn't let me
undress her for bed.

931
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:43,880
Well?

932
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,040
She must have been hiding
a document on her person

933
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,560
that she hid in her trunk
in the secret drawer.

934
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,720
Thank you for telling me this,
Mademoiselle.

935
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,480
Go back to her.

936
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,600
A plot is afoot.

937
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,920
And I suspect Anne of Austria
is part of it.

938
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,840
How can we be sure?

939
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,920
By attacking.
That's the best defense.

940
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,760
Your Majesty, his Eminence
would like to see you.

941
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,720
My God!

942
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,480
What can he want?

943
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,120
Don't make him wait.

944
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Excuse my intrusion, your Majesty.

945
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,640
I came to pay my respects

946
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,480
before leaving to join the king.

947
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,600
I'm touched.
I know your time is precious

948
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,440
and your work is heavy.

949
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,320
Nothing would be possible
without the king's trust.

950
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,720
Yes.

951
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,760
I pray for his victory every day.

952
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,720
But it breaks my heart to see
so many Catholics kill each other,

953
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,480
when my brother offers peace.

954
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,760
I have a request, your Majesty.

955
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,200
"A request," your Eminence?

956
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,640
Before this journey

957
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,160
from which I may never return,

958
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,200
I'd like to greet the dauphin.

959
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,480
Of course.

960
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,760
Mademoiselle de Chémerault!

961
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,640
Your Majesty?

962
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,040
Ask Madame de Lansac
to bring the dauphin Louis

963
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,560
to the cardinal.

964
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,360
Right away, your Majesty.

965
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,920
I'll pray for your safe return,
your Eminence.

966
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,160
I'm sure that your fervent
and sincere prayers

967
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,000
will protect me.

968
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,160
May God protect your Highness!

969
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,360
Enjoy him before the king returns,
your Majesty.

970
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,080
What do you mean,
your Eminence?

971
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,160
Before he left,

972
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,000
the king told me

973
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,040
he won't let you
bring up the prince.

974
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,040
But why?

975
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,920
His Majesty is fed up
with your plotting

976
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,640
with France's enemies.

977
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,440
You understand he cannot
stand for the queen of France

978
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,480
to share intelligence
with those he is fighting.

979
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,560
Some at the Court even call it...

980
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,640
treason.

981
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:00,200
Take away my son?
I couldn't bear it.

982
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,520
A sign of good faith

983
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,880
would make his Majesty
give up this plan,

984
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,440
which he is reluctant to carry out.

985
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,080
You will have it,
Monsieur de Richelieu.

986
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,960
Father! Father!

987
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,880
What's going on?

988
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,720
You must save me, Father.

989
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,040
The king and the cardinal
suspect me of treason.

990
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,200
They threaten
to take away my child.

991
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,560
Calm down, your Highness.
No one will talk.

992
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,280
We all took an oath.

993
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,280
Oaths are worth little in prison.

994
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,960
You must help me, Father.

995
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,640
- What can I do?
- Here.

996
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,360
Take this document.

997
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,480
Get it into the cardinal's hands.

998
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,640
- How?
- It doesn't matter.

999
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,160
No one must know
how he came by it.

1000
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,560
Or it's death for you.

1001
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,520
Trust me.

1002
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,200
How can I refuse you, your Majesty?

1003
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,360
At dawn, I'll send
one of my monks.

1004
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,520
He won't speak, for he's mute.

1005
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,360
God bless you, Father.

1006
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:05,000
Bishop's Palace in Narbonne

1007
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,960
Welcome, Count.

1008
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,080
Thank you, your Excellency.

1009
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,920
Victory!

1010
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,600
Long live the king!

1011
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,800
Take care of the wounded.

1012
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,000
Come, let me kiss you.
I've never seen such courage.

1013
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,920
- I only did my duty.
- More than that.

1014
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,520
But promise
you'll risk your life no more.

1015
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,920
I can't lose you.

1016
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,320
My life doesn't count, Sire.
Think only of your glory.

1017
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,640
How I love you! Come.

1018
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,440
Let's celebrate your exploits.

1019
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,240
Count, here you are finally!

1020
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,440
Where's my prime minister?

1021
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,360
Resting in Narbonne.

1022
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,640
His rheumatism pains him.

1023
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,400
He'll be happy to see you
if you go there.

1024
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,840
We'll go, Count.

1025
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:36,160
Let's celebrate the Grand Squire,
who took the fort of Rivesaltes,

1026
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,600
an incredible feat.

1027
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,720
Congratulations, Monsieur.

1028
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,000
You should've seen his energy
as he led his men.

1029
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,120
He seemed immortal.

1030
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,160
Alas, we suffered losses.

1031
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,720
The essential thing is that
you're alive.

1032
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,440
Monsieur de Chavigny,
tell his Eminence we'll come see him.

1033
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,720
I want to tell him of our victory.

1034
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,440
If Henri d'Effiat shone in battle
as you say,

1035
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,160
we should be glad, Chavigny.

1036
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,880
It was time he did something.

1037
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:19,880
Indeed.

1038
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:23,800
The king showers him with praise
and has never been so taken with him.

1039
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,880
What is that?

1040
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,280
A mixture of frog and bat secretions

1041
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,960
that a Jewish doctor recommended.

1042
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,840
Fine. We're a step away from heresy.

1043
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,800
Who are you?

1044
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,160
Wait.

1045
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:18,440
Stop him!

1046
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,560
By the devil's horns!

1047
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,160
He's dead.

1048
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,240
Well, Chavigny!
Did you see the devil?

1049
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,800
Almost, my lord. Look at this.

1050
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,520
The seal of the house of Austria.

1051
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,960
- What is this?
- I don't know.

1052
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,560
It was given to me by a monk
who killed himself

1053
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,560
rather than be taken.

1054
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,160
He must've had a good reason
to prefer hell to heaven.

1055
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,520
By the Holy Spirit!

1056
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,760
It's impossible.

1057
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,560
Well?

1058
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,560
This is high treason, Chavigny.

1059
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,400
A conspiracy as never seen in France.

1060
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,040
What exactly?

1061
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,120
A shameful treaty
signed in great secrecy

1062
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,400
between the king of Spain
and Gaston of France.

1063
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,400
To stab us in the back.

1064
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,840
The traitor sold
the kingdom to our enemies.

1065
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,840
All the names are here:

1066
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,840
Duke de Bouillon,
Count de Fontrailles, and guess who?

1067
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,840
The Marquis de Cinq-Mars.

1068
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,040
A serpent that I raised myself.

1069
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,040
An ingrate given glory

1070
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,400
who kisses the king
even as he kills him.

1071
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,960
It's an unspeakable crime.
We must take action.

1072
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,480
We will, Chavigny. Don't worry.

1073
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,880
I'd like to know
who brought us this evidence

1074
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,560
for the upcoming trial.

1075
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,320
Should I take it to the king?

1076
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,120
No. I must show it to him myself.

1077
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,760
Otherwise you'd be in danger.

1078
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,480
In danger?

1079
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,400
He is so blinded by his passion
for Cinq-Mars

1080
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,760
that he'll call you a liar
and have you killed.

1081
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,840
Your Majesty.

1082
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,120
What joy to see you,
my dear minister!

1083
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,040
Have you heard the news?

1084
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,160
Thanks to the Grand Squire,
the way is clear

1085
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,760
for the siege of Perpignan.

1086
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,800
I'm glad, your Majesty.

1087
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,560
My warmest congratulations,
Grand Squire.

1088
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,480
His bravery was so outstanding

1089
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,480
that I gave him
the command of our army.

1090
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,600
That's not appropriate, your Majesty.

1091
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,160
Excuse me?

1092
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,920
Why not?

1093
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:21,480
Many generals with titles
grander than that of marquis

1094
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,920
will be insulted.

1095
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,000
Their titles are not titles of glory.

1096
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,040
Do you seek to anger me?

1097
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,320
Am I king, yes or no?

1098
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,600
Do you doubt my ability to decide
who should lead our army?

1099
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,200
Don't insist, Sire.

1100
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,200
Mr. de Richelieu thinks I'm unworthy
of dying on a battlefield.

1101
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,840
I judge you for what you are,
Mr. de Cinq-Mars.

1102
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,560
Explain yourself, your Eminence.

1103
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,720
I have nothing to say to you. Leave.
I must speak to the king.

1104
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,200
My word, your Eminence!

1105
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,560
Believe me, your Majesty.

1106
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:04,440
I must speak to you now
of an extremely important matter.

1107
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,720
This is the last time
you show me the door, sir.

1108
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,920
Finally, something we can agree on.

1109
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,000
Henri!

1110
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,080
I'm very displeased, your Eminence.

1111
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,920
You know my affection for him.

1112
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,320
Why treat him that way
in front of me?

1113
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,080
Here's my answer, your Majesty.

1114
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,600
It's not possible.
This is a crude forgery.

1115
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,080
Alas, Sire.

1116
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,560
Those are indeed
the signatures of Philip IV

1117
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,880
and your brother.

1118
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,200
And the seal
is from the house of Austria.

1119
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,880
"It is decided that
his Majesty Philip IV

1120
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,200
"will deal only with his Highness
Gaston of France

1121
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,520
"and that Spain will recover
all the forts that

1122
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,080
"King Louis XIII has..."

1123
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,040
If this treachery is real,

1124
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,760
it's the most vile treason.

1125
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,360
What did I do to my brother
that he should plot against me?

1126
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,800
You reign, your Majesty.

1127
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,480
He was always my mother's favorite.

1128
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,800
Marie de Medici
made him unreliable,

1129
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,880
a fickle man who fucked
all the women of my Court!

1130
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,720
Finish reading, your Majesty.

1131
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,000
You don't yet know all.

1132
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,480
"150,000-crown pension
for his Highness Gaston d'Orléans,

1133
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,200
"20,000 crowns
for the viscount de Fontrailles,

1134
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,040
"40,000 crowns
for the Grand Squire..."

1135
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,160
No.

1136
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,640
It's impossible.

1137
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,480
This is not true.

1138
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,000
It's another one of your schemes!

1139
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,600
I won't be fooled.
This time you've gone too far.

1140
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,440
What do you accuse me of,
your Majesty?

1141
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,600
Of adding his name
to this shameful conspiracy.

1142
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,040
You hate him
because he won't serve you.

1143
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,920
He told me so.

1144
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:48,400
You're capable of such deception,
sir.

1145
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,160
Accusing Henri d'Effiat
of high treason

1146
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:57,040
when he just risked his life
at Rivesaltes...

1147
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,200
it makes no sense.

1148
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,640
That's possible, your Majesty.
I'd like to believe it.

1149
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,760
But the kingdom is at stake
and you must not hesitate.

1150
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,440
You must sign prison orders,

1151
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,040
so our soldiers
can seize these traitors.

1152
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:20,680
We can release the Grand Squire
when he proves his innocence.

1153
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,320
But if he's guilty, he will flee.

1154
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,960
Let's keep my brother
from doing more harm.

1155
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,160
He's the soul of the plot.

1156
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:34,160
It won't be easy.
But knowing his vanity,

1157
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,640
we've perfected a trap
that will bring him to us.

1158
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,480
I'll kill him!

1159
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,360
I tell you, I'll...

1160
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,640
I'll kill him tonight.

1161
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,760
You should've done it just now.

1162
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,760
In front of the king?

1163
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,680
That's impossible.

1164
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,760
But I'll do it tonight.

1165
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,240
I'll smother him in his sleep,
and no one will miss him.

1166
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,480
From someone who wishes you well.

1167
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,760
"You're in danger. Flee."

1168
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:17,880
Big news.

1169
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,480
You're mad!
It's the king's handwriting.

1170
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,480
Why not the Pope's?

1171
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,040
Good God, save yourself!

1172
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,040
Don't you see you're in danger,
despite the king's friendship?

1173
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,600
I don't fear the cardinal.

1174
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,480
We found him in a tavern.

1175
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,840
The king will punish you
for this humiliation,

1176
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,760
Cardinal.

1177
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,880
Tonight you'll be taken
to Lyon and secretly put

1178
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,200
in the royal fort of Pierre-Encise,

1179
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:58,200
until your accomplices join you,
Grand Squire.

1180
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,760
What accomplices?
What are you talking about?

1181
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,760
Take him away!

1182
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,080
Wait. What do you accuse me of?

1183
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,600
Your Eminence! Answer.
I want to see the king.

1184
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,040
I want to see Louis.

1185
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,720
Château of the Duke de Lorraine

1186
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,280
You here?

1187
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,800
Greetings, your Highness.

1188
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,920
I've ridden for 6 days
to bring you an order from the king.

1189
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,200
From my brother? I'm listening.

1190
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,800
He wants you to command
the army of Champagne

1191
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,640
to defend our borders
against the Spanish.

1192
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,800
Here's his letter naming you general.

1193
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,480
I will heed my brother's call.

1194
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,000
I'll saddle my horse
and come with you. My sword!

1195
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,280
Thank the duke, gentlemen.
And safe travels.

1196
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,720
Your Highness, please,
give me your sword.

1197
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,920
What, Count?

1198
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,200
Upon the king's order,

1199
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,640
I arrest you!

1200
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,640
Your Majesty, Mr. de Thou
needs to speak with you urgently.

1201
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,640
We've been betrayed.

1202
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,520
My God! How is it possible?

1203
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,560
A copy of the treaty
fell into the cardinal's hands.

1204
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,200
It's a betrayal.

1205
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,080
"A betrayal"?

1206
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,920
By whom?

1207
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,640
Will we ever know?

1208
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,920
Farewell. I must leave
France before I'm arrested.

1209
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,800
Your Majesty!

1210
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,360
Your Majesty, open up!
King's orders.

1211
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,280
It's too late. Farewell, Madame.

1212
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,440
I love you
and will never reveal your name,

1213
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:33,480
even under questioning.

1214
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,640
Thank you, my friend.

1215
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,080
May God protect you!

1216
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,200
Your Majesty!

1217
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,200
I have orders to arrest Mr. de Thou.

1218
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,520
Well, go ahead, captain! Go ahead!

1219
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,360
I'm yours, Monsieur d'Artagnan.

1220
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,520
Perpignan is ours, Sire.

1221
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,360
The admiral's ships
have destroyed the Spanish fleet.

1222
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,920
And the people opened the gates.

1223
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,520
The Spanish are fleeing
for the Pyrenees.

1224
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,800
That's good, Tréville.
What news of the Grand Squire?

1225
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,520
"The Grand Squire"?

1226
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,080
He was arrested, Sire.

1227
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,240
"Arrested"? Arrested, you say?

1228
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:39,920
His Eminence took him to Lyon
to be tried.

1229
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,640
Maybe that's best.

1230
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,600
He'll soon be declared innocent.
It cannot be otherwise.

1231
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,920
To your horses!

1232
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,520
To Lyon!

1233
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,520
Royal Prison of Lyon

1234
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,360
How you've disappointed me.

1235
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,680
As you have me, my lord.

1236
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,960
Your insolence won't save you.
I'm not the king.

1237
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,520
That's certain.

1238
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,680
You have neither his imagination
nor his deep soul.

1239
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,880
You don't know me well.

1240
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,520
I know your heart is barren
and that's enough.

1241
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,600
What are you made of?
Is there blood in your veins?

1242
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,640
Enough that I believed in you,

1243
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,640
but you're not what I hoped.

1244
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,360
You did not inherit
your father's moral values.

1245
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,400
I forbid you to speak
of my father or of morals.

1246
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,880
The game is over, Henri.

1247
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,240
No more indulgence.

1248
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,240
You're in the hands of justice.

1249
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,960
What "justice"?

1250
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,240
Yours?

1251
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,800
Which condemns before the trial?

1252
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,760
I'm only guilty of loving a duchess
and being loved by the king.

1253
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,600
Very little indeed.

1254
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,040
How could you get involved
in this conspiracy

1255
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,400
betraying France to Spain?

1256
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,240
Was it love
for the Duchess de Nevers

1257
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:31,400
or hatred for me,
though I treated you like a son?

1258
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,800
"A son"?
You deceive yourself, sir.

1259
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,680
You know nothing of a father's love.

1260
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,520
A father wants
only his child's happiness.

1261
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,760
But you, charitable soul,

1262
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,120
want to have spies everywhere
and people to serve you.

1263
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:55,240
Bringing you into the sublime
workings of my politics

1264
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,760
was my greatest sign of love.

1265
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,960
Is politics everything to you?

1266
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,960
Farewell.

1267
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,680
The chancellor will question you.

1268
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,240
I have nothing to say to him.

1269
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,520
Think it over.

1270
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,560
Your life is at stake.

1271
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,960
His Majesty will free me.
He knows what love is.

1272
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:42,680
I was impressed by the ruse
you used to offer me these...

1273
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,280
lovely lodgings,
Monsieur du Plessis.

1274
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,800
What does my brother accuse me of
this time?

1275
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,400
Something that threatens
your very life.

1276
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,040
You have committed
a crime against the state

1277
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,120
that cannot be pardoned.

1278
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,200
Impossible, your Eminence.

1279
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,680
As God is my witness, I've always
been loyal to France and the king.

1280
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,960
Do you know this treaty?

1281
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,560
It's signed by you
and King Philip IV of Spain.

1282
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,120
Who gave you this?

1283
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:25,200
The only way to save yourself
is to make a full confession.

1284
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:30,840
I'll tell all, your Eminence,
if the king will pardon me.

1285
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,680
The names of those who took part
in this high treason?

1286
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:40,080
Yes. Starting with the Grand Squire
who is the mastermind.

1287
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:45,200
I expected more nobility
from the son of Henri IV.

1288
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,480
It's true that you've
already sold many of your friends.

1289
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,120
I said only the truth, as you asked.

1290
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,960
To each his own truth, your Highness.

1291
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,280
What do you mean?
I'm a prince of the blood.

1292
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,640
The king alone can judge my actions!

1293
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,920
Your Majesty!

1294
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,920
I must speak with you.

1295
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,280
In private.

1296
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,840
What is it?

1297
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,000
We must save the Grand Squire.
The cardinal has arrested him.

1298
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,680
Are you in love with
Mr. de Cinq-Mars? I can't believe it.

1299
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,400
It doesn't matter
whether or not I love him.

1300
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,280
I don't want him to die.

1301
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,720
You're losing your head, Marie.

1302
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,400
The king loves him too much.

1303
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,280
He'll never let the cardinal
go so far.

1304
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,680
I already told his Eminence

1305
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,800
I have nothing to say.

1306
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:53,920
It doesn't matter.

1307
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,440
Here's the statement
of his Highness, Duke d'Orléans.

1308
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,240
He accuses you of many crimes.

1309
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,440
Another of the cardinal's tricks.

1310
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,120
Read it yourself.

1311
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,800
And see the signature at the bottom.

1312
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,280
Does a prince's oath mean nothing?

1313
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,160
I believed in him
and he sends me to my death.

1314
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,440
You cannot trust the powerful,
Marquis.

1315
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,640
They play with our lives.

1316
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,720
But you can save yours.

1317
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:39,720
Tell us how and why
you got involved in this crime.

1318
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:14,840
Where is he? I want to see
the Grand Squire right now!

1319
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,560
That's impossible, Sire.

1320
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:20,080
The chancellor is questioning him
now in prison.

1321
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,680
He'll go free. Henri is innocent.

1322
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,000
My respects, your Majesty.

1323
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:32,280
Well, sir,
have you released the Grand Squire?

1324
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,160
He's guilty, Sire.

1325
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,840
That's impossible.

1326
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
He just admitted his crimes.
Look, Sire.

1327
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,880
These are lies!

1328
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:46,560
Henri couldn't betray me.
I know him.

1329
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:50,720
He's a pure soul led astray
by my cunning brother.

1330
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,160
You're the guilty one.

1331
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,880
You can't forgive him
for loving me more than you.

1332
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,600
Your resentment isn't motivated
by the kingdom,

1333
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,960
but by your bitter heart.

1334
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,720
You want revenge against this child

1335
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,720
whom you pampered
but whose love you lost.

1336
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,040
Isn't that true,

1337
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,320
Monsieur de Richelieu ?

1338
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,040
You are confused, Majesty.

1339
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,760
My only concern
is for your safety and glory.

1340
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,560
You couldn't stand him leaving you
or me loving him.

1341
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,880
Or that he's free as a bird.

1342
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,680
You rejected him,

1343
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,960
humiliated him,

1344
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,120
made him desperate.

1345
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,600
And you'll condemn him
to make him disappear forever.

1346
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,120
I want the king's justice

1347
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,160
to punish
those who threaten state security.

1348
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,400
Mr. de Cinq-Mars,
along with Mr. de Thou,

1349
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,320
is guilty of high treason.

1350
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,840
He must die.

1351
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,040
My only mistake
was introducing him to you.

1352
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:04,440
So you're as guilty as he is.

1353
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,680
I demand the Grand Squire
be set free.

1354
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,880
In that case, Sire,

1355
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,000
you must free me
of my government duties.

1356
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,280
What? You'll put
your ministry at stake?

1357
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,000
Have I any choice?

1358
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:28,720
A king must prefer justice to pity.

1359
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,760
Henri d'Effiat must die
for betraying you and France.

1360
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,320
No!

1361
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,760
I won't have it.

1362
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,200
I won't allow it.

1363
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,720
Others have died for less.

1364
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,880
Do you know no pity?

1365
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,840
You would compromise

1366
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:01,600
all that we've built for years,
your Majesty.

1367
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:07,480
Will you put your authority
and the unity

1368
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,840
of the kingdom in danger?

1369
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,320
Forget your heart
and its passions, Sire.

1370
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,160
Sign,

1371
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,840
and think of your subjects

1372
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,160
who want justice
to protect them from traitors,

1373
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,560
even those who are handsome,
young, and charming. Sign.

1374
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,680
Be strong with me.

1375
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,600
As we've always been.

1376
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,600
Sign.

1377
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,160
You know I'm right.

1378
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,440
Will I never have peace?

1379
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,840
Only the peace of the kingdom
counts, Sire.

1380
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,920
By signing,
you aren't striking a head,

1381
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,680
but raising your throne.

1382
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,200
Are you satisfied,

1383
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,120
Prime Minister?

1384
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,040
You have your enemies' head.

1385
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:26,000
I have no enemies
but those of the state, Sire.

1386
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,120
Where are you going?

1387
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,040
To Paris, your Majesty,

1388
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,600
where the university leaders
wait for me

1389
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,840
to inaugurate the new Sorbonne
we have built.

1390
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:06,080
It's not a humane task
to rule France, Chavigny.

1391
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:09,360
You've given France your all
for 18 years, your Eminence.

1392
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,040
It's never been so powerful.

1393
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:14,200
There's still much to be done.

1394
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,640
And my remaining time is short.

1395
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,280
Positions!

1396
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,920
Lift!

1397
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:44,080
March!

1398
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:53,960
Leave!

1399
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:56,400
Get out, all of you! All!

1400
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,040
No.

1401
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,400
I want to die with my eyes open.

1402
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:02,440
God knows I loved that child.
