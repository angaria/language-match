1
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,280
This programme contains very strong language.

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,440
Sir John.

3
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,240
Your Majesty. Welcome.

4
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
I lost my hat, riding here.

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,360
It's never too late.

6
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,720
You should marry again, have another family.

7
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,960
Perhaps you'll find a bride, while you're here with us.

8
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,880
INAUDIBLE CHATTER

9
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
HENRY GENTLY SNORES

10
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,080
Francis Weston...

11
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,600
I believe your gentlemanly touch is required.

12
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,320
Perhaps we should make a noise,

13
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,480
to wake him naturally?

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,360
Someone laugh?

15
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,880
Yes, do that, Tom.

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,440
I wasn't asleep.

17
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,800
Just resting my eyes.

18
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,440
WINGS FLUTTER

19
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,280
This is no time to be shy.

20
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,600
Tell Cromwell what Henry asked you.

21
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,440
He asked me if I would look kindly on him.

22
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
If he wrote me a poem, for instance.

23
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,080
I said I would.

24
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,440
Good.

25
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,960
But if he attempts anything on your person...

26
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,440
..scream.

27
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,640
What if nobody comes?

28
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
Don't scream.

29
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Pray...

30
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,480
out loud.

31
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,840
Something that will appeal to His Majesty's piety

32
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,400
and sense of honour.

33
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,480
I'll get my prayer book.

34
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,080
I'm sure I can find something that will fit the bill.

35
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,920
Thomas Cromwell, Secretary to the King.

36
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Show your colours!

37
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,600
Tell him to let us in, before I show his arse my boot.

38
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,680
Well...

39
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,240
..how do I look?

40
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,840
That's why he sent you, isn't it?

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,920
To see if I really am dying?

42
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,840
He used to call me his flower.

43
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,000
When my first son was born, it was winter.

44
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,880
There were no blooms to be had.

45
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,200
He gave me six dozen roses...

46
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,480
..made of the purest white silk.

47
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Over the years, I have given them to those who have done me some service.

48
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,080
Will...

49
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,120
Will you let the Princess Mary visit me?

50
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
What harm can it do the King?

51
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,960
Chapuys has written to the lady Mary,

52
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,120
saying that he can get her out of the country.

53
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,520
Never!

54
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,120
I answer for it with my life.

55
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,720
What does Henry imagine?

56
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,200
Mary, returning with an army,

57
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,840
turning him out of his Kingdom?

58
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,160
It's laughable.

59
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,240
I answer for her intentions with my own person.

60
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,880
Your own person has a lot to do, madam -

61
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,120
guaranteeing this, answering for that.

62
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,520
You can only die once.

63
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,280
And when I do...

64
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,200
..I will set Henry an example,

65
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,000
for when his own time comes.

66
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,080
Do you think about the King's death a lot?

67
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,800
I think about his afterlife.

68
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,480
Ah.

69
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,600
How is Boleyn's daughter?

70
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,360
She lost the child, I am told.

71
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,920
I know how that is.

72
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
Hmm.

73
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,360
She and the King have hopes of another child, soon.

74
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,360
Particular hope,

75
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
or general hope?

76
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,240
My thoughts always confided in you.

77
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,680
I do hope there is no rift.

78
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
Well? Is she?

79
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,040
She's said nothing, still?

80
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,640
Of course, the wise woman says nothing

81
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,520
until she feels the quickening.

82
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,760
Yes.

83
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,480
She's been wrong before...

84
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,800
..but, yes.

85
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,120
Does the King know?

86
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,080
You should tell him. He might knight you on the spot.

87
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,240
I suppose it's to be expected.

88
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,040
She was with the King for much of the summer -

89
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,440
and when he wasn't with her, he would write her love letters

90
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,080
and sent them by the hand of Harry Norris.

91
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,480
My lady, I must leave you.

92
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,480
SHE SIGHS

93
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,880
And you were usually such a good listener.

94
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
The window was open.

95
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,760
He was such an innocent...

96
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,400
What kind of monster would do such a thing?

97
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,880
Perhaps he got up on the ledge somehow and...

98
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
then his paws slipped.

99
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,760
- Paws slipped? Paws slipped? 
- Oh, get away, Mary!

100
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,840
Oh, yes -

101
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,440
I've re-baptised my fool.

102
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,440
Well...

103
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,040
the King's daughter is almost a dwarf, isn't she?

104
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
The French will have a shock if they ever see her.

105
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,040
- They'll have a shock. 
- Yes.

106
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,040
I know they're trying for a match between her and the Dauphin.

107
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
While my own daughter...

108
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
I told you to go to France and negotiate her marriage.

109
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,520
- But you said you were ill... 
- I was ill.

110
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,440
You're never ill -

111
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,280
unless you want to be.

112
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,440
Huh.

113
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,880
And now the French laugh behind my back.

114
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,480
The French never intended a match.

115
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,000
It's as if my daughter had never been born.

116
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,520
As if Katherine was still Queen.

117
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,240
As if I didn't exist.

118
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,960
I won't let them make a royal match for Mary.

119
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,080
I want you to visit her.

120
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Take one of your handsome young men with you.

121
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,120
She's never had a compliment in her life -

122
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,640
it shouldn't be hard to seduce her.

123
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,440
You want me to compromise her?

124
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,520
Mm.

125
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,960
Do it yourself, if you want.

126
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,120
I heard she liked you.

127
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,920
All that's needed is for her to make a fool of herself in public,

128
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,560
so she loses her reputation.

129
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,120
No.

130
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,920
No? No?

131
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,960
What?

132
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,480
That's not my aim.

133
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,240
Those are not my methods.

134
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,280
I know you're talking to the Seymours.

135
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,400
You think it's a secret,

136
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,120
but nothing is secret from me.

137
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
I can't believe you'd put your money on such a bad risk.

138
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,120
There was a time, madam, that you would listen to my advice.

139
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,840
Let me advise you now.

140
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,960
Drop your plans and schemes.

141
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,680
Put down the burden of them.

142
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,800
Keep yourself in quietness, until your child is born.

143
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,040
For Jane...

144
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,480
..she's a distraction, that's all.

145
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,280
Let it run its course.

146
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,280
- Pretend that you don't even see her... 
- He'll never abandon me.

147
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,480
Never.

148
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,000
Since my coronation, there is a new England

149
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,880
and it can't subsist without me.

150
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,640
I'm warning you...

151
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,360
..make terms with me, Cremuel...

152
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
..before my child is born.

153
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,200
I hear you're going to put all the nuns and monks out on the road.

154
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,360
Monsieur Chapuys,

155
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,040
wherever my commissioners go,

156
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,640
they meet monks and nuns who come to them, begging for their liberty -

157
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,320
and after the scandals I've heard, I'm not surprised.

158
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Monks selling broken meats from the Last Supper to the poor.

159
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,720
Young novices being visited in their beds by older monks.

160
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,800
They claim they're living the "vita apostolica",

161
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,440
but you didn't find the apostles

162
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,520
feeling each other's bollocks, did you?

163
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Tell your master I mean good religion to increase, not wither.

164
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,760
I won't tell my master lies, if I tell him what I see.

165
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,120
I see discontent.

166
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,640
I see famine, before the spring.

167
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,080
You're buying corn from the territories of the Emperor.

168
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,200
This trade could be stopped.

169
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,120
What could your master possibly gain, by starving my countrymen?

170
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,240
He would gain this - he would see how evilly they are governed!

171
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,800
Henry begins by mocking the Pope -

172
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,520
he will end up embracing...

173
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,160
..the devil.

174
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,400
Eustache...

175
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,040
..what's happened?

176
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,920
What is this?

177
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,880
I have news from Kimbolton.

178
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,240
Queen Katherine...

179
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,520
She has only one or two days to live and I don't want her to...

180
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,200
Thomas, I don't want her to die alone,

181
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,520
without anyone who loves her.

182
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,960
And I'm afraid the King won't let me go.

183
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,560
Will you let me go?

184
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,720
It would be a kindness

185
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,400
to let her have a visit from Ambassador Chapuys.

186
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,640
Why?

187
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,320
So he can intrigue with her more conveniently?

188
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,560
Her doctors suggest, Madam, that she will very soon be in her grave.

189
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,680
She'd fly out of it, shroud flapping,

190
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,080
if she thought she could cause me trouble.

191
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,960
Your Majesty, the Emperor may be a fond nephew,

192
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,640
but he won't keep up the quarrel for a dead woman.

193
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,520
This could mean the end to the threat of war - a new era.

194
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,000
Ambassador Chapuys...

195
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,560
Ambassador Chapuys...

196
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,240
has never acknowledged my wife as Queen.

197
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,760
Until he is prepared to bow before her, publicly,

198
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,080
there will be no diplomacy with that man.

199
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,200
KATHERINE GIVES LONG, HEAVY SIGH

200
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,800
LADIES SOB

201
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,360
At last, God!

202
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,920
Not before time!

203
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,080
She's very much looking forward to seeing her younger brother -

204
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,920
aren't you, dumpling?

205
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,640
And I share her impatience.

206
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,360
It has been a long enough wait.

207
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,240
I suppose we must expect the country to mourn for her.

208
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,000
She was once given the title of "Queen".

209
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
Mistakenly.

210
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
Majesty,

211
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,080
do you wish the body brought to St Paul's?

212
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,680
We will lay her to rest in Peterborough.

213
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,040
It will cost less.

214
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,080
She sent me a letter.

215
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,320
I don't want it.

216
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,920
Get rid of it, will you?

217
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,920
Richard Rich says the King wants Katherine's plate and furs.

218
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,000
Rich had to point out that if she was never, in fact, his wife,

219
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
he has no right to her property.

220
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,480
Oh, he'll have the furs.

221
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,600
'I commend unto you our daughter, Mary...

222
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,920
PRIESTS SING LATIN PRAYERS

223
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,120
'..beseeching you to be a good father to her...

224
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,960
'..and lastly,

225
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,440
'I make this vow...

226
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,920
'..that mine eyes desire you, above all things.'

227
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,840
FIRE CRACKLES

228
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
If I'd been with you,

229
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,920
I could have put you out of danger.

230
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,240
I'd have beat it with a... with a blanket.

231
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,800
Oh, thank goodness that you...

232
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,200
If I'd been here...

233
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,600
Leave it!

234
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
Peace, my husband,

235
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,080
I am not harmed.

236
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,200
My Lady.

237
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,680
Let me drink this.

238
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,080
This was a good piece...

239
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,840
Yes, what is it?

240
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,920
Water must be kept at hand

241
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,480
and a woman appointed on every rota,

242
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,960
to check that all the lights are being extinguished.

243
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,400
I can't imagine how this could have happened.

244
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,120
First, this is a household matter and not within your remit.

245
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,600
Second, she was in no danger.

246
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
Third, I don't know who lit the candle.

247
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,960
Four, if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

248
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Five, no-one will tell you either.

249
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,960
If, as it may happen,

250
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,760
some person visits the Queen after the lights are out...

251
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,200
..then it is an event over which we should draw a veil.

252
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,440
Some person?

253
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,800
Some person, for the purposes of arson?

254
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
Or the purposes of something else?

255
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,880
Lady Rochford...

256
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Jane, when the time comes to unburden your conscience,

257
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,560
don't go to a priest.

258
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,000
He'll give you penance.

259
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,560
I'll give you a reward.

260
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,160
BELL TOLLS

261
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,560
How much does the lordship of Ripon bring in to the Archbishop?

262
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,360
A little over £260, sir.

263
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
How much does Southwell bring in?

264
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,920
A scant £150.

265
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,800
Ha? I thought it would be more.

266
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,640
Majesty...

267
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
..in the tournament, today?

268
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,160
Hmm?

269
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,200
If you should run against my son, Gregory,

270
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,240
will you forbear to unhorse him...

271
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,840
..if you can help it?

272
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,600
We can't help what we do, really.

273
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,720
When you're thundering down at a man, you can't check.

274
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,080
It's a very rare event, you know, Crom...

275
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,240
..to bring down your opponent.

276
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,760
If you're concerned about what showing he'll make, you needn't be.

277
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
He's very able.

278
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,840
I don't really mind what showing he makes.

279
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,200
I just don't want him to be...

280
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,320
flattened.

281
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,080
CROWD CHATTERS

282
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,840
HORSES WHINNY

283
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,360
You can't come.

284
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,680
Rafe is back.

285
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,040
I have to talk to him about some abbeys he's been surveying.

286
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,680
And there's my papers...

287
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,280
Richard will be here, to represent me.

288
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,480
It's my first joust.

289
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,920
The Vatican has given Henry three months to return to obedience,

290
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,360
or the bull of excommunication against him

291
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,680
will be distributed through Europe.

292
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,800
The Emperor's fleet is set for Algiers

293
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,640
with 40,000 armed men.

294
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,200
The Abbot of Fountains

295
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,720
has been systematically robbing his own treasury,

296
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,600
parliament opens in a fortnight.

297
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,160
The King says you're a credit to my house.

298
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,680
And you are.

299
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,400
Some years ago, before you were born,

300
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,880
I met an old Portuguese knight in Venice - one of those men

301
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,200
who made a career of riding to tournaments, throughout Europe.

302
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,040
I don't know... For what it's worth...

303
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,680
He said the secret to jousting was to sit easily in your saddle,

304
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,520
like you're going out to take some air.

305
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,280
Carry your lance loose, until the very last moment

306
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,640
and above all else...

307
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,600
..defeat your instincts to...

308
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,240
..survive.

309
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,440
Well, you're ready.

310
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,400
You look good.

311
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,240
Thank you.

312
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,280
Present.

313
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,520
You have to guess.

314
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,200
RATTLE

315
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
St Appollonia's teeth?

316
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,360
No.

317
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,960
Teeth from the comb of Mary Magdalene?

318
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,640
St Edmund's nail parings.

319
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,480
Tip them in with the rest.

320
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,360
The man must have had 500 fingers.

321
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,480
What else?

322
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,160
The prior at Maiden Bradley claims he has a licence, under papal seal,

323
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,680
allowing him to keep a whore.

324
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,120
Westminster Abbey bought the bones of a dead elephant.

325
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,280
Now, tell me what they wanted with... FOOTSTEPS

326
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,200
DOOR OPENS

327
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,520
Gregory?

328
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,840
It's the King, it's... it's Henry.

329
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,960
He's dead.

330
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,800
Ah.

331
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,640
The tournament hadn't begun.

332
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,160
The King was running towards the ring and the horse just went down.

333
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,280
No-one was near him, no-one to blame.

334
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,800
Master, if this is true...

335
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,480
If he is dead...

336
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,360
Should we escape now, before they block the ports?

337
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,240
Fetch Fitzwilliam.

338
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,720
VOICES SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER

339
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,760
Move, move!

340
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,920
Move! Move!

341
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,000
- Fetch a mirror to his lips. 
- It was tried.

342
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,960
What do you mean, leaving him lying here,

343
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,080
untouched by Christian hands?!

344
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,920
By God, Cromwell - you're a dead man!

345
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,640
My Lord Norfolk, My Lord Norfolk! Where is the Queen?

346
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,040
On the floor.

347
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,000
I told her myself.

348
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,720
My place to do it.

349
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,600
She warned you to be obedient.

350
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,680
And now she's Regent, your days are finished!

351
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,080
No, no, no!

352
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,960
No woman with big belly as Regent.

353
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,560
Me! Me!

354
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,840
- Gregory! 
- We've brought the Master Treasurer.

355
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,200
Thank you, thank you.

356
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,360
The Princess Mary - if she falls into Boleyn hands, she's dead.

357
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,800
We have to get up-country before this news does.

358
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,640
Go, Fitzwilliam. Go quickly.

359
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,560
Mary's keepers are Boleyns. What if they won't yield her?

360
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Well, then she's dead.

361
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,920
We let her fall into the hands of the papists,

362
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,240
they'll set her up as Queen - and I'm dead.

363
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,320
There'll be civil war.

364
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,720
I don't know...

365
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,040
A woman cannot rule, Cromwell! A woman cannot rule!

366
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,400
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

367
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,160
The King's breathing, the King's breathing!

368
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,640
Long live the King!

369
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,120
CHEERING

370
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,040
Come on, come on.

371
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,240
Come on, come on.

372
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,880
Come on... There you are, there you are!

373
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,120
There you are! Do you see me? That's it, that's it.

374
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,520
CHEERING

375
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,800
Get back, move away. Let him breathe!

376
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,880
Let him breathe, let him breathe.

377
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,800
How many men can say,

378
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,040
"My only friend is the King of England?"

379
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,840
You'd think I have everything...

380
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,880
..but take Henry away...

381
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,480
I don't know, Crom.

382
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,160
You're not without support, you know?

383
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,200
Forgive my scepticism.

384
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,280
I mean, you would have support...

385
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,440
..should you need it, against the Boleyns.

386
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,440
Well, why should I need that?

387
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,480
The Queen and I are perfect friends.

388
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,160
FITZWILLIAM SNIGGERS

389
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,960
Forgive my scepticism.

390
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,960
This support...?

391
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,080
Sir Nicholas Carew says he thinks...

392
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,120
you're an easy fellow to get on with.

393
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,400
Does he?

394
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,000
Perhaps...

395
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,920
Perhaps you should dine with him?

396
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,080
What would have happened, Crom...

397
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,600
if the king had not recovered?

398
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,760
Anne would have all, to rule herself.

399
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,560
Though she'd have a fight with her Uncle Norfolk.

400
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,760
Between the two of them, which one would I back?

401
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,000
The lady, I think.

402
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,200
Let the lady be Regent

403
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,440
and the Boleyns will walk on our backs.

404
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,400
And your head will be on a spike.

405
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,520
HE SIGHS

406
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,400
But of course, that will come to pass anyway...

407
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,440
if she gives Henry a son.

408
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,200
My Lord...

409
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
I pray -

410
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,640
the whole of England prays -

411
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,280
that you will never joust again.

412
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,480
Why not geld me, while you're at it?

413
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,440
That would suit you, wouldn't it, madam?

414
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,520
ALL GASP

415
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,760
COURT WHISPERS

416
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,200
SHE GASPS AND MOANS

417
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,680
SHE GIGGLES

418
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,120
The child had the appearance of a male

419
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,160
and of about 15 weeks' gestation.

420
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,360
What do you mean, "the appearance of?"

421
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,640
I only repeat the words of the doctor...

422
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Oh, get away with you, woman! You've never given birth.

423
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,800
What do you know?

424
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,240
There should've been a matron at her bedside -

425
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,440
but oh, no -

426
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,720
you Boleyns must all crowd in, whenever disaster strikes.

427
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,240
DOOR SHUTS

428
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,280
I see that God will not give me male children.

429
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,480
If a king cannot have a son...

430
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,480
If he cannot give stability to his realm...

431
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,280
..then it doesn't matter what else he can do.

432
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,400
The victories...

433
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,280
the just laws...

434
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,240
..the famous courts...

435
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,320
..nothing.

436
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,160
It seems to me...

437
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,600
that I was dishonestly led into this marriage.

438
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,280
How...dishonestly?

439
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,120
It seems to me I was seduced...

440
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,840
..practised upon...

441
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,360
..perhaps with charms?

442
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,520
With spells? Women do such things.

443
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,160
And if that were so...

444
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,920
..the marriage would be null, wouldn't it?

445
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,480
LADIES WHISPER

446
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,960
'He sent her a purse - the King.

447
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,200
'Christ knows how much was in it.'

448
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,520
What did she do?

449
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,760
She sent it back.

450
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,560
And the letter he sent with it?

451
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,840
'She didn't open it.

452
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,520
'But before she returned it...

453
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,440
'She kissed the seal.

454
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,200
'Kissed it!

455
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,280
'What genius possessed her?'

456
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,080
Now Henry's walking around, talking about "the virtuous and chaste Jane".

457
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,840
What do you say to that?

458
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,840
The game's changed, Cromwell.

459
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,040
Now that Anne has failed again,

460
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,640
it's possible that Henry may wish to remarry.

461
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,360
As long as the King holds by the present Queen,

462
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,960
I will hold by her, too.

463
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,760
So you have no interest of your own in this?

464
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,440
I represent the King's interests.

465
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,600
That's what I'm for.

466
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,960
My Lord Bishop,

467
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,920
I hear you're leaving us for France?

468
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,520
We shall miss you.

469
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,160
I went down to Putney...

470
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,520
..or to be accurate, I sent a servant. I learnt things about you.

471
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,800
You've killed a man.

472
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,480
Not in this jurisdiction.

473
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,760
Do your worst, Stephen.

474
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,680
Put your men on the road,

475
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,480
lay out money,

476
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,720
search Europe...

477
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,440
You'll not find any talent I possess that England cannot use.

478
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,360
That lad you knifed in Putney died.

479
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,920
You did well to run, Cromwell.

480
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,960
The family had a noose for you.

481
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,880
Your father...bought them off.

482
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,720
What?

483
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,280
You see?

484
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,480
I know things about your life you don't know yourself.

485
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,200
I am disturbing you?

486
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,960
Eustache?

487
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,160
No, I was just remembering.

488
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,800
Sit down.

489
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,240
The cardinal used to tell people that I was an orphan...

490
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,520
..or else that...

491
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,680
I don't know... I was Irish.

492
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,880
Recently escaped from prison.

493
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,680
He said it was wise to deceive others about your past,

494
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,960
even if there was nothing to conceal.

495
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,480
But I was wondering...

496
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,640
whether it's possible to deceive oneself.

497
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,840
About what?

498
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,040
Something you believed about your life.

499
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,160
Who you are...

500
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,120
What you are.

501
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,680
You attended the funeral?

502
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,120
I refused to.

503
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,400
She was not buried as a queen.

504
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,600
I hear the concubine wore yellow, to celebrate Katherine's death?

505
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,240
She thought her passing would change her position.

506
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,240
So it may, but perhaps not in the way she thinks.

507
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,680
There is talk about this "Semer" girl.

508
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,480
May I meet her?

509
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,800
And here I thought you'd come just for my company.

510
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,320
The lady you refer to is called "Seymour" -

511
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,440
and I'm surprised you take such an interest.

512
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,400
I would have thought you were more interested

513
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,560
in which French princess Henry will marry,

514
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,920
should he dissolve his current arrangements.

515
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,720
Cremuel, you told me that was a fairy tale!

516
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,840
You have expressed yourself a friend of my master.

517
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,120
Tell me you won't countenance a French match?

518
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,280
CROMWELL LAUGHS

519
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,760
I have influence on King Henry, Eustache...

520
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,920
..but I do not claim to govern him.

521
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,680
To succeed with Henry, you have to anticipate his desires.

522
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,920
But then...

523
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,040
..if he changes his mind...

524
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,720
..you stand out there...

525
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,240
..expose, no?

526
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,960
It's Anne you should fear.

527
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,120
She is desperate and dangerous.

528
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,440
Strike first, before she strikes you.

529
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,000
Remember how she brought down Wolsey.

530
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,120
Perhaps you should come to mass, at court?

531
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,680
CHOIR SINGS

532
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,720
Cromwell!

533
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,080
You knew this was going to happen.

534
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,240
After all this time avoiding her,

535
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,880
avoiding having to acknowledge her...

536
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,800
This will get back to the Emperor.

537
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,520
Let's hope he will understand.

538
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,760
It had to be done, Eustache.

539
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,280
Why?

540
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,520
Princes do not think as other men do.

541
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,440
Now you have acknowledged his second marriage.

542
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,920
Now, if he likes...

543
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,920
..he can let it go.

544
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,600
When the Boleyns closed around him - poor fellow.

545
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,800
Looked as if he was being carried off by slavers.

546
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,440
He didn't know what country he was going to wake up in.

547
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,840
No more do I.

548
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,880
Let's go - find a crust to gnaw on somewhere - leave them to it.

549
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,640
Cromwell?

550
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,160
My master the Emperor hopes you will look kindly

551
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,520
on a Spanish match for Princess Mary.

552
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,320
You presume too much, Chapuys!

553
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,880
Do not presume to know my policy, ambassador!

554
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,680
So this was all a bargaining tool, was it?

555
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,120
- Your Majesty... 
- You bow to my wife, then you send me the bill?

556
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,240
I have not forgotten how I helped your master against the French.

557
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,120
He promised me territory -

558
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,880
next thing I hear, he's making a treaty with Francois!

559
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,480
The Emperor treats me like an infant!

560
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,720
First he whips me, then he pets me, then he whips me again!

561
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,080
Well, tell him I am not an infant!

562
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,560
And tell him to keep out of my family business!

563
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,240
First he tells me how I should marry,

564
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,960
then he wants to show me how to deal with my own daughter!

565
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,840
I demand a profound and public apology!

566
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,440
I don't know what I'm supposed to apologise for!

567
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,200
I come here in good faith,

568
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,480
I'm tricked into meeting that creature face to face -

569
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,960
and then I'm attacked by Henry!

570
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,400
He wants my master, he needs my master -

571
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,280
and instead, he plays these games!

572
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,760
Peace, peace.

573
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,520
We will do the apologising. Let him cool down.

574
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,400
- Never fear, we can keep the talks going... 
- Cromwell!

575
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,160
I know what you've done.

576
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,760
You have gone too far in this matter.

577
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,600
You've made him promises, haven't you?

578
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,400
Well, you have no authority!

579
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,640
You have put my honour in jeopardy!

580
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,600
What did I expect?

581
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,640
What would a man like you know about the honour of princes?

582
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,000
You've told him you have the king in your pocket?

583
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,440
Don't deny it!

584
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,480
You would train me up, like one of your boys -

585
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,840
have me touch my cap when you come down in the morning

586
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,720
and say "How do you, sir?"

587
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,680
Well, I really believe

588
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,720
you think you are the King...

589
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,720
and I am the blacksmith's boy!

590
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,160
Don't you?

591
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,520
Don't you?

592
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,400
God preserve Your Majesty.

593
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,040
And now...

594
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,680
..will you excuse me?

595
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,400
HAMMER ON ANVIL ECHOES

596
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,840
THOMAS SCREAMS

597
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,840
Cross your wrists.

598
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,080
Like this.

599
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,000
Get it in the water.

600
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,320
Keep your wrists crossed.

601
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,760
THOMAS WINCES

602
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,280
Confuses the pain.

603
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,040
DOOR OPENS

604
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,320
I trust a lesson has been learnt?

605
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,160
You are not a gentleman born.

606
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,680
You should not meddle in affairs of those set above you.

607
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,400
His Majesty may be pleased to bring you into his presence...

608
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,880
LAUGHTER

609
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,720
Come, Wolsey! We're fetching you to Hell,

610
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,280
where Beelzebub is expecting you to supper!

611
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,640
But you should always remember who it was

612
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,840
that placed you where he could see you.

613
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,280
From now on, remember who you serve.

614
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,280
I shall profit from this lesson...

615
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,120
I assure you, sir.

616
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,400
See you do.

617
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,760
And so...

618
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,720
Majesty, if it please you...

619
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,360
Look favourably on the Emperor's overtures...

620
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,200
..we beg you.

621
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,760
For the sake of the realm and the commonweal.

622
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,840
Well, if it's for the good of the commonweal, I...

623
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,640
I shall begin negotiations with Chapuys.

624
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,480
I suppose I must swallow any personal insults I have received.

625
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,440
Other topics will not be open for discussion.

626
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,720
The Emperor has discussed Mary with his own councillors.

627
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,000
He'd like her married to his own relatives.

628
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,920
I will in no wise suffer her to leave this country,

629
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,080
until her behaviour to me is as it should be.

630
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,960
Myself...

631
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,840
I'd go up-country -

632
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,080
and if she would not sign the oath,

633
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,120
I'd beat her head against the wall, till it were soft as a baked apple.

634
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,200
Thank you for that, my Lord Norfolk.

635
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,920
Her mother's death is still raw with her.

636
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,560
I have no doubt that she will see her duty,

637
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,240
in these next weeks.

638
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,280
How pleasing to hear from you at last, Cromwell.

639
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,000
Are we to assume that this new-found reticence of yours

640
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,920
relates to yesterday's events?

641
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,320
When His Majesty, if I do recall correctly,

642
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,600
administered a check to your ambition?

643
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,880
Thank you again, My Lord Wiltshire.

644
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,160
There will be no foreign match for Mary.

645
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,800
That is final.

646
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,640
Will you walk with me?

647
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,160
I wish we would go down to the weald one day -

648
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,560
talk to the ironmasters.

649
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,720
I've had various drawings - mathematical drawings and advices...

650
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,680
..concerning how our ordnance can be improved, but I...

651
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,440
I can't...

652
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,880
I can't make as much of it as you would.

653
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,720
It's because...

654
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,040
Well...

655
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,720
Because you are my right hand, sir.

656
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,640
So, shall we go down?

657
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,680
You and I, meet the charcoal burners?

658
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,000
Of course.

659
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,600
But not this summer, sir.

660
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,720
I think you will be too busy.

661
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,280
Yeah.

662
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,720
I cannot live as I have lived, Cromwell.

663
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,720
You must free me from this...

664
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,480
..from Anne.

665
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,240
Perhaps she and Harry Percy...

666
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,720
They were good as married, weren't they?

667
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,760
And if that won't run, you know I was...

668
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,320
I was, on occasion, with Anne's sister, Mary?

669
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,240
Perhaps having been with kin so near...

670
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,480
Anyway...

671
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,000
I trust in your discretion and your skill.

672
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,960
Be very secret.

673
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,840
Does not Mistress Seymour have the tiniest hands?

674
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,480
"Doesn't she have the tiniest hands?"

675
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,000
"Does she not have the whitest throat?"

676
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,400
Has she not the wettest cunt you've ever groped?

677
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,680
THEY SNICKER That's enough.

678
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,040
Cromwell's spy is about.

679
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,720
They talk about the Queen.

680
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,920
They?

681
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,120
Weston, Brereton...

682
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,640
sometimes Norris.

683
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,400
Go on.

684
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,800
The Queen needs to conceive another child, quickly.

685
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:53,080
And they say that Henry cannot be trusted to do the deed, so...

686
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,640
one of them has to step in and do him a favour.

687
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,440
Do they come to any conclusion?

688
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,680
They wouldn't really do it - none of them. It's just talk.

689
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,640
So do they come to any conclusion?

690
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,280
I think it's every man for himself.

691
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,400
Well, I'm sure you're right.

692
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,520
Sounds like idle talk.

693
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,960
I don't think it will be necessary to use this...

694
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,880
..but thank you, Rafe.

695
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,280
Trouble is, Thomas...

696
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,880
The King wants a new wife.

697
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,000
Fix him one.

698
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,880
I didn't...

699
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,840
..and now I'm dead.

700
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,200
WOLSEY CHUCKLES
