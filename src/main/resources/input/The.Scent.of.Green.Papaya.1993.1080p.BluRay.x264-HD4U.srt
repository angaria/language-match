1
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:29,261
Who's there?

2
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:30,596
It's Mui.

3
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:31,722
Ah, Mui...

4
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:34,099
I'll open the door.

5
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,645
You can come in.

6
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:56,288
Follow me.

7
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:08,133
THE SMELL OF THE GREEN PAPAYA

8
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:30,132
It's little Mui,
our new servant girl.

9
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:38,724
Poor thing, she walked
a whole day to get here.

10
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:50,319
If To was still alive,
they'd be the same age.

11
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,613
Let's not talk about that...

12
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,158
Perhaps she's better off
where she is now.

13
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:05,459
It's the curfew soon
and Trung isn't back yet.

14
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,295
Mother's going to bed.

15
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:11,298
I'll go up and help her.

16
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:15,779
Ah, Trung...

17
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,448
Aren't you in bed yet, father?

18
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,669
Go back to sleep.
The mistress said so.

19
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:38,046
I'll wake you to make the fire.

20
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:57,125
Remember... For this dish,
the oil has to be hot.

21
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,671
Fry the vegetable.

22
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:04,090
Burn it for flavour.

23
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:07,218
Not too much or it gets all soft.

24
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:09,721
Then you put it aside.

25
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:12,932
You do the same with the meat.

26
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,770
Put that in the water.

27
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:25,278
Fat make the boiled vegetable shine.
It looks nicer.

28
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:29,115
Whether it looks nice or not,
we eat it.

29
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:31,576
But the masters are different.

30
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:35,079
Once it's cooked...

31
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:51,221
Then share it between 2 plates.

32
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,100
Don't forget to keep some for us.

33
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,939
There, grandmother
has finished her prayers.

34
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,316
Put the vegetables in the water.

35
00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:08,988
Whose mother is she?

36
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,157
The master's. Wash your hands.

37
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:15,912
She lost her husband
just after the master was born.

38
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:19,457
Now, she spends
all her time praying.

39
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,460
Quick, put some rice in a big bowl.

40
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:50,488
Is it all ready?

41
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,198
Yes, it's ready.

42
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:54,867
Mui, take grandmother's tray.

43
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,287
It's alright, I'll take it.

44
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:59,455
Take this one then.

45
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:38,202
Father, I'm eating out
with Khuyen.

46
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:41,164
Have your nap as usual.

47
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:43,708
We'll be back for tea.

48
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,877
And me, can l?

49
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:47,920
No, you're too little.

50
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:54,260
Mui, go and get some more soup.

51
00:12:56,054 --> 00:13:00,933
Mother would like you
to keep her company during meals.

52
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,435
I'm going up too!

53
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:19,118
Take this upstairs.

54
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:49,148
Eat up. You're going to be late.

55
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:52,819
No classes now, grandmother.
It's summer holidays.

56
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:54,695
Ah yes, that's right...

57
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,348
We're going, mum.

58
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:07,685
Khuyen and l
will be back for tea.

59
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,979
Alright, I'll buy cakes.

60
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:10,938
Good-bye, madam.

61
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:12,815
Good-bye.

62
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:21,449
Mui, you can eat now.

63
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,201
Lam, eat up, dear.

64
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:26,329
Enjoy the meal, mum.

65
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,171
Here's your bowl. Eat.

66
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:39,175
There's no soup left.
What a nuisance.

67
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:44,597
Upstairs or downstairs,
we spread it out and have none left.

68
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:47,016
After, wash the dishes.

69
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:50,603
Who was that man with Mr Trung?

70
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:54,690
That's Mr Khuyen,
Mr Trung's friend. Eat up.

71
00:21:49,628 --> 00:21:50,462
Tin!

72
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:11,733
Thank you. Good-bye.

73
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,777
Good-bye.

74
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:01,032
Mui, wash your hands
and go to buy 10 cakes.

75
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:57,422
In 3 months, you'll go home
to visit your mother.

76
00:23:59,382 --> 00:24:00,717
Thank you, madam.

77
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,668
Mui, hurry up. It's almost time
to light the fire.

78
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,516
Little girl...

79
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:24,360
Your name?

80
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,654
I'm called Mui.

81
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:28,865
I see... You're Mui...

82
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:31,117
My name is Thuan.

83
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:34,162
It's almost time for prayers.

84
00:26:34,412 --> 00:26:35,830
Is grandmother well?

85
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,249
Yes, she's well.

86
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:42,462
That's very good then!

87
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:44,464
Very good!

88
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:47,091
Thank you, little Mui.
Good-bye...

89
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:48,968
Good-bye, Mr Thuan.

90
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:07,820
Where are you going?

91
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:09,364
For some fresh air.

92
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,241
Yes, in this heat,
it's hard to sleep.

93
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:16,287
Watch out for the curfew.

94
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:35,932
What heat...

95
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:38,810
My God, what heat...

96
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:40,937
It's alright...

97
00:27:41,229 --> 00:27:44,023
You can put your things away
tomorrow.

98
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:47,026
You've worked enough today.

99
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:48,945
Get some rest.

100
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:58,454
Where are your parents?

101
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:02,250
Do you have brothers or sisters?

102
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:05,002
My father died three years ago.

103
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:08,131
My mother and my sister
are still in my village.

104
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:11,134
Will you go to see them soon?

105
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:16,556
The mistress said in three months,
I'll see my mother again.

106
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:19,851
That's good. The mistress is kind.

107
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:27,567
Before, who slept on this bed?

108
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:31,446
A servant like you and me.

109
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,157
She went home to get married.

110
00:28:34,323 --> 00:28:37,743
Is the photo on the altar
the grandmother's husband?

111
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,744
Yes.

112
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:42,373
When he died,
he was still young.

113
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:49,422
Who's the little girl?

114
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:52,675
It's a sad story.

115
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:55,761
She was the masters' daughter.

116
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:58,389
Her name was To.

117
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,600
She died seven years ago.

118
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,062
If she was still alive,
you'd be the same age.

119
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:10,193
How did she die?

120
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:16,782
A disease.

121
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:19,368
But the master thinks
it's his fault.

122
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:20,703
Why?

123
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:23,206
Seven years ago,

124
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:28,044
the master left the house
with all the family's money.

125
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:33,507
It was the third time
he'd done that.

126
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:39,263
Before, when he'd spent it all,
he came back.

127
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:43,809
But that time,
he was away longer than usual.

128
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:50,066
But the other times,
when he came back,

129
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:52,610
she didn't say anything?

130
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,988
Nothing. Not a single word.

131
00:29:56,197 --> 00:29:58,616
She was happy.
She cried for joy.

132
00:30:00,576 --> 00:30:02,453
What about To then?

133
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:04,914
The curfew...

134
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:12,964
There, a little fresh air.
The master must be back by now.

135
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:21,847
Three weeks after he left,

136
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:24,183
To fell ill.

137
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:28,145
And the day before he returned,
she died.

138
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:31,273
He must have thought she died

139
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,568
to atone for the sins
he had committed.

140
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:38,698
That's why he never leaves
the house anymore.

141
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:44,453
Right, let's sleep...

142
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,956
Tomorrow, we have to be up early.

143
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:16,962
Mother...

144
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:24,970
Mother...

145
00:32:30,517 --> 00:32:31,685
Mother...

146
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:48,994
Get up. It's time.

147
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:03,133
You're lucky.

148
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,262
At your age,
you still have sweet dreams.

149
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:16,522
What did you dream about?

150
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:17,982
I don't know...

151
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:20,317
My God...
I'd like to dream.

152
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:24,405
But I haven't dreamed for ages.
Let's go and wash.

153
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:47,803
Some mornings,

154
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,684
I wake up with the image
of an old woman in my mind.

155
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:57,521
Perhaps it's because
I dreamed at night.

156
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:01,567
But I don't know if the old woman
is my mother

157
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:03,569
or if she's me.

158
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,913
My God, who's in the kitchen
this early?

159
00:34:27,718 --> 00:34:29,845
Mistress, are you already up?

160
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:48,530
Any rice left?

161
00:34:48,697 --> 00:34:51,283
Just enough for 4 or 5 days.

162
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,245
This is for the market.

163
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:58,207
Make sure there's enough to eat
for a few days.

164
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:24,900
See these earrings?

165
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:29,404
The master has left
with all the money again. My God!

166
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:51,885
Let's go and clean our teeth,

167
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:53,595
wash our faces,
hands and feet.

168
00:35:53,762 --> 00:35:55,597
Then comb our hair.

169
00:35:55,764 --> 00:35:57,975
And don't forget the toilet.

170
00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:50,819
No, not that one either.

171
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:52,237
I'm sorry...

172
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:54,114
It's alright. Good-bye.

173
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,574
Good-bye.

174
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:08,128
What's wrong?

175
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:09,212
I had a fight.

176
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:10,338
Who with?

177
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:11,965
The children.

178
00:37:12,174 --> 00:37:13,925
Did they hurt you?

179
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:17,929
Is daddy home?

180
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:25,437
No. Go and ask Mui
for some clean clothes.

181
00:38:53,692 --> 00:38:55,819
When there's not enough,

182
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:58,947
use a lot of salt.
That way,

183
00:38:59,114 --> 00:39:02,033
they'll eat more rice
with the dishes.

184
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:05,203
For the boiled vegetables.

185
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:19,801
Take this upstairs.

186
00:39:33,732 --> 00:39:35,734
Mother said to start.

187
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:47,120
Ugh! It's too salty!

188
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:49,706
Look.

189
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:06,931
Eat.

190
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:23,573
Is it good?

191
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,204
Little Mui... Come here.

192
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:37,540
I want to ask you something.

193
00:42:51,888 --> 00:42:53,473
Thank you, Mr Thuan.

194
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:55,600
Is grandmother well?

195
00:43:35,848 --> 00:43:37,433
We're almost out of rice.

196
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:41,479
We haven't sold a yard of cloth.

197
00:43:42,105 --> 00:43:44,190
Two reels of cotton...

198
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:47,735
What can we buy with the money
from two reels?

199
00:43:47,902 --> 00:43:49,403
My God...

200
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:09,900
It's your fault.

201
00:45:10,067 --> 00:45:12,403
If you'd known how to love him,

202
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,239
he wouldn't have left
with other women.

203
00:45:20,494 --> 00:45:22,413
I knew from the start:

204
00:45:23,497 --> 00:45:25,458
my son would be unhappy with you.

205
00:45:28,127 --> 00:45:29,920
You have a husband

206
00:45:30,963 --> 00:45:33,716
and you don't know
how to make him happy.

207
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,188
Alright, that's enough.

208
00:47:13,816 --> 00:47:15,860
What about the rest of the papaya?

209
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:17,570
Throw it away.

210
00:47:54,315 --> 00:47:55,024
Enough!

211
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,317
Take this up.

212
00:48:16,462 --> 00:48:19,006
It's alright.
You can go and eat.

213
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:29,391
Enjoy it, mother.

214
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:34,313
When will daddy be back?

215
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,315
I don't know... Eat.

216
00:48:41,403 --> 00:48:43,405
Why are you crying like that?

217
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:46,325
Why doesn't daddy come home?

218
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:47,451
Shut up!

219
00:50:24,006 --> 00:50:24,715
Thank you.

220
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:26,550
My pleasure. Good-bye.

221
00:50:26,717 --> 00:50:28,218
Good-bye.

222
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,699
That's it, money for rice.

223
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:54,328
Go and buy 25 kg of rice.

224
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,517
Hurry. We have to cut the meat.

225
00:51:17,684 --> 00:51:19,561
There... Put that there.

226
00:52:01,812 --> 00:52:03,605
It's very good rice!

227
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:08,527
- We have a guest tonight.
- Who?

228
00:52:08,902 --> 00:52:10,028
Mr Khuyen.

229
00:52:12,197 --> 00:52:13,657
Who's Mr Khuyen?

230
00:52:13,824 --> 00:52:15,867
Mr Trung's friend, of course!

231
00:52:25,877 --> 00:52:29,047
Can I fry the vegetables
on my own?

232
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:32,342
Yes, if you want.

233
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:33,278
Three years after grandfather died,

234
00:53:33,445 --> 00:53:36,114
she still loved her husband

235
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:39,993
and refused to marry me.

236
00:53:41,328 --> 00:53:46,750
Since that day, I've watched her
from a distance.

237
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:52,130
She's moved house several times
and I've always followed her.

238
00:53:53,256 --> 00:53:56,426
That's how we were able to meet,
you and l.

239
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:08,230
Since To's death,
grandmother hasn't been downstairs.

240
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:14,110
I haven't seen her
for seven years now.

241
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:23,286
Tell me, little Mui,

242
00:54:23,453 --> 00:54:27,165
couldn't you get her down
into the yard

243
00:54:27,332 --> 00:54:29,084
so that I can see her?

244
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:31,461
Why don't you go to see her?

245
00:54:31,628 --> 00:54:34,506
If you hid, she wouldn't see you.

246
00:54:35,632 --> 00:54:37,926
No, that's not possible.

247
00:54:39,302 --> 00:54:41,513
If she saw me,
it would be terrible.

248
00:54:43,932 --> 00:54:46,184
No, it's not possible.

249
00:55:01,658 --> 00:55:03,034
Go on, go up!

250
00:56:18,526 --> 00:56:19,986
It doesn't matter.

251
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:26,159
My God!

252
00:56:28,703 --> 00:56:31,247
The mistress is fond
of these vases.

253
00:56:31,998 --> 00:56:33,833
They're very old antiques.

254
00:56:35,001 --> 00:56:38,630
All my savings
wouldn't be enough to buy one.

255
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,925
You're lucky.

256
00:57:52,954 --> 00:57:55,206
Mistress, wake up, quickly!

257
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:17,413
A very valuable piece
but without its twin,

258
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,541
it's worth next to nothing....
It's up to you.

259
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:22,126
Alright, I accept.

260
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:45,329
Trung, quick!

261
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:12,731
10 YEARS LATER

262
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:28,664
Mui!

263
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:31,959
Hurry!
My mother wants to see you.

264
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,373
For some time now,
business has been slack.

265
01:04:53,749 --> 01:04:56,877
If it goes on like this,
we'll have problems.

266
01:05:00,089 --> 01:05:03,383
The inner yard isn't used
for anything.

267
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:06,303
We should have
another parrot farm.

268
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:08,388
Yes... We'll see...

269
01:05:09,848 --> 01:05:12,851
In that case, I'll ask around.

270
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,647
Mother's talking to Mui right now.

271
01:05:17,356 --> 01:05:21,985
Mui won't be that badly off
with your friend Khuyen.

272
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,532
He lives alone
and writes music...

273
01:05:27,032 --> 01:05:29,284
His parents are rich.

274
01:05:29,743 --> 01:05:32,996
She'll be better paid
than she is here.

275
01:05:58,146 --> 01:06:01,400
I would have given these to To
if she were alive.

276
01:06:24,464 --> 01:06:27,968
Without knowing it,
you've always been a great comfort.

277
01:06:28,302 --> 01:06:31,680
Thanks to you,
I feel I've had a daughter.

278
01:06:38,645 --> 01:06:41,648
Lam has left.
He needs somewhere to write.

279
01:06:43,275 --> 01:06:45,777
Now, you're the one who's leaving.

280
01:06:56,622 --> 01:06:59,082
For a long time,

281
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:02,377
I hoped Lam would take you
as his wife.

282
01:09:51,379 --> 01:09:54,341
My daughter... my little daughter!

283
01:13:44,445 --> 01:13:47,615
Don't eat!
Take me to a restaurant.

284
01:13:55,623 --> 01:13:57,291
Have you got a lot done?

285
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:59,710
Play me what you've written.

286
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:18,104
That smells good.

287
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,940
How's your new servant?

288
01:14:22,066 --> 01:14:23,151
Alright.

289
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,903
What does that mean, "alright"?

290
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:27,822
She works hard...

291
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:31,242
I'm not asking you that.
But it doesn't matter.

292
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:34,620
Where's the vase I gave you?

293
01:14:34,787 --> 01:14:35,705
It's broken.

294
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:37,123
Broken?

295
01:14:37,373 --> 01:14:39,917
You mean: "She broke it"!

296
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:44,505
If I say she did it on purpose,
what would your answer be?

297
01:27:19,008 --> 01:27:23,012
I wonder what percentage
of women in Vietnam

298
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:25,932
have never touched
their fiance's head.

299
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:29,269
My mother told me that before

300
01:27:29,435 --> 01:27:31,229
they used to teach girls

301
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:35,275
that a well-educated woman
should never do it.

302
01:27:37,527 --> 01:27:40,488
She also said
that it's almost two weeks

303
01:27:40,697 --> 01:27:42,782
since you last came to see us.

304
01:27:43,074 --> 01:27:45,118
Your father's surprised too.

305
01:36:14,251 --> 01:36:17,671
In... my... garden...

306
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:22,092
there's... a... papaya... tree...

307
01:36:23,719 --> 01:36:25,679
The papaya...

308
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:28,348
hang... in bunches...

309
01:36:29,308 --> 01:36:30,601
The ripe papaya...

310
01:36:30,767 --> 01:36:33,896
have a pale yellow colour.

311
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:39,359
The ri... The ripe papaya...

312
01:36:39,651 --> 01:36:43,655
are sweet with a sugary taste.

313
01:36:48,285 --> 01:36:52,789
We've been raising a black dog

314
01:36:53,165 --> 01:36:57,210
for three years now.

315
01:36:59,129 --> 01:37:01,214
His body is long.

316
01:37:01,381 --> 01:37:04,092
He has big feet.

317
01:37:08,722 --> 01:37:10,390
His body is long.

318
01:37:10,933 --> 01:37:13,769
He has big feet

319
01:37:13,936 --> 01:37:17,147
and big ears.

320
01:39:41,416 --> 01:39:43,001
I'll start, okay?

321
01:39:46,338 --> 01:39:49,674
The spring water,
nestled in a hole in a rock,

322
01:39:49,883 --> 01:39:52,844
shimmers softly when disturbed.

323
01:39:54,804 --> 01:39:56,973
The vibrations of the ground

324
01:39:57,265 --> 01:40:00,018
have given birth to strong waves

325
01:40:00,185 --> 01:40:03,438
which crash together
in an irregular swell

326
01:40:03,939 --> 01:40:06,858
on the surface,
without cresting.

327
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:12,238
If there 's a verb
meaning "to move harmoniously"

328
01:40:12,447 --> 01:40:15,492
it must be used here.

329
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:20,205
The cherry trees,
gripped in shadows,

330
01:40:20,872 --> 01:40:23,291
spread out and curl up,

331
01:40:23,917 --> 01:40:27,128
sway and twist,
to the rhythm of the water.

332
01:40:28,672 --> 01:40:30,423
But the interesting thing
is that...

333
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:32,634
however much they change,

334
01:40:32,884 --> 01:40:35,971
they keep the shape
of a cherry tree.
