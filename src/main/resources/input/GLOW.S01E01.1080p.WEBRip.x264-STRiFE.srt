00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,448
Okay.

174
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,202
I said I'd do anything,
so, here we fucking are.

175
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,954
Okay.

176
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,081
Hello, ladies.

177
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,165
- Hello.
- Hi.

178
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm Sam Sylvia.

179
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,545
Today we're just gonna be doing
first looks and first cuts.

180
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,630
- Are there sides?
- I didn't get any sides.

181
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,342
This is how this is gonna go, all right?
No more talking. Just sit there...

182
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,261
and look at me and smile.

183
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,178
Okay?

184
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,722
Tell us what the hell we're doing here.

185
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,932
Oh...

186
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,268
- Hi, Cherry.
- Hey, baby.

187
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,728
- How you doing, baby? Mm-hmm.
- Good.

188
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,981
This another one of your
trashy vampire movies?

189
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,399
What? No.

190
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,775
This is not a movie.

191
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,653
This... is GLOW.

192
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,698
Sorry, what's GLOW?

193
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,701
Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

194
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,203
This is a wrestling television show.

195
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,913
Only ladies. Lady wrestling.

196
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,707
Just like the big guys, but girls.

197
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,667
Get it? Girl on girl.

198
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,503
- What?
- So, like, Hulk Hogan?

199
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,756
If one of you turns out to be Hulk Hogan,
I've hit the fucking jackpot.

200
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,427
All right, take it easy.
This is what's happening.

201
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,721
Yes, this is a wrestling show, and yes...

202
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,766
you're all gonna have to actually wrestle
on cable television

203
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,184
for thousands of people.

204
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,144
That means...

205
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,563
- tit grabs...
- [woman] Tit grabs?

206
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,732
Cunt punches, shrinky dinks.

207
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,651
That move that looks like a catfight,
but fancy.

208
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,861
Did I say cunt punches?

209
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,362
- Yeah.
- [Sam] Okay, good.

210
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,991
- [chattering]
- So, if any of you have a problem

211
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,076
with, uh, doing a wrestling show...

212
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,996
I suggest you leave now.

213
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,208
[chattering indistinctly]

214
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:51,836
[Sam] Thank you.

215
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,507
Really? You're going?

216
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,593
Thank you.

217
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,094
[woman] Bye.

218
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,224
- [woman 2] Bye.
- [woman 3] Good luck, guys.

219
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,560
[chuckles]

220
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,146
What happened there?
You just... decided?

221
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,065
- Yeah.
- All right, for those remaining,

222
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,859
congratulations, you made it
through the first round of cuts.

223
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,111
- Pretty painless, right?
- [laughing and chattering]

224
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,198
I guess what we gotta do now is,
I'm gonna sit over there...

225
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,325
and you guys are gonna line up,

226
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,701
get your headshots out,

227
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,871
and I'm also gonna have to have you sign
a waiver...

228
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,040
in case of, uh, serious injury,

229
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,459
and/or death.

230
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,543
[women murmuring]

231
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,259
You seem to be very versatile
with window coverings.

232
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,303
Well, I'm from London, so... [chuckles]

233
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,222
- I don't know what that means.
- Yeah.

234
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,724
- Your eyes are closed.
- That's what happens when you blow.

235
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,643
- Can you blow with your eyes open?
- Okay.

236
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,523
Resume gets a little thin after 1979.

237
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,151
- Movies get a little white after 1979.
- Mm-hmm.

238
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,362
You've seen my stunts.
I can kick. I can punch.

239
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,697
I can do horse work, car work...

240
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,157
Yeah, I know you can double,
but can you act?

241
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,576
Freeze, motherfucker.

242
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,038
- Next.
- Wow.

243
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,499
Yeah. I'm gonna need you to do that, too.

244
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,334
[chuckles]

245
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:16,963
What is that?

246
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,679
- Here.
- Look at you. You're like the parade.

247
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,723
- Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

248
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,890
I throw things.

249
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,644
- Do you think you could throw people?
- Yeah.

250
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,896
All right. Well, come back tomorrow.

251
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,815
- [Reggie] Yeah.
- [Sam] Whoa.

252
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,027
We're hairstylists at the Carlton Salon
at the Beverly Center.

253
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,362
Our clients think we're funny
and should be on television.

254
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,072
- You get two for one.
- I'm exhausted.

255
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,157
[Sam] How old are you?

256
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,117
Nineteen.

257
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,245
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

258
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,122
Okay. We'll see.

259
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,626
Yeah. Come on.

260
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,923
Ruth Wilder. Looks like you.

261
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,467
Yeah. It's a headshot.

262
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,303
Oh. Strindberg. Who the fuck is that?

263
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,432
- Oh, it's a playwright.
- I'm kidding. I know who Strindberg is.

264
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,558
I'm not an idiot.

265
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,018
So, what are you, like a...

266
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,019
Like a real actor?

267
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,645
Yeah.

268
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,815
I've done a bunch of plays in Omaha,

269
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,984
at a little spot called
the Blue Barn Theatre.

270
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,528
I did a film a few years back.

271
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,325
I've also done extensive mask work
and clowning workshops.

272
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,371
How much acting will there be?

273
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,330
As opposed to what?

274
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,374
Hair pulling?

275
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,585
- You don't like wrestling?
- Well, I don't really know wrestling.

276
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,128
You don't think wrestling is acting?

277
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,506
It's not, is it? It's...

278
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,425
It's more like a sport with costumes?

279
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,220
Or... Sorry, are you...
Are you hiring actors

280
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,972
to play wrestlers,
or are we the wrestlers?

281
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,099
Yes.

282
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,433
Which one?

283
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,313
Do people think you're pretty?
Because, like, I'm looking at you...

284
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,149
One second, I think,
"Fuck, yeah, she's hot,"

285
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,153
and then the next second I'm like,
"I don't know. Is she? Really?"

286
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,532
I mean, you just have one of those
faces that kind of... changes.

287
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,991
Like, "Eh... Hmm."

288
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,119
I don't know.

289
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,372
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means I don't know.

290
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,581
Ruth.

291
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,083
Ruth.

292
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,543
Ruth.

293
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,086
That is not a great name.

294
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,796
[sighs]

295
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,090
Hey, guys. It's me.

296
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,885
I really didn't wanna do this again,

297
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:32,140
but, um... I need you guys to...
wire me $200

298
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,142
so they don't turn off my phone...

299
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,645
and so I can eat.

300
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,857
I'm really sorry.

301
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,192
I swear this is the last time.

302
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,362
I love you.

303
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,659
Oh, I, uh... got a call back.

304
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,371
So, fingers crossed, again.

305
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,331
Okay.

306
00:15:59,041 --> 00:15:59,876
Bye.

307
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,342
[panting]

308
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,596
Hello? Hello?

309
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,223
I have mace!

310
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,766
Wait. It's me.

311
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,436
[gasps] Oh, my God!

312
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,273
What are you doing?
Why are you climbing in my window?

313
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,400
You said you didn't want anyone
to find out about us.

314
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,111
- I took that seriously.
- No, no. Climb out. Go.

315
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,655
Are you kidding me?

316
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,201
You know how hard that was?
You ever tried to climb a trellis?

317
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,327
Wh...?

318
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,287
[exhales deeply]
I'm pretty proud of myself.

319
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,498
For trying to cheat on your wife again?

320
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,834
[sighs] Let's not... Don't...
Please, can we not use those words?

321
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,505
This isn't normal behavior for me.
[sighs]

322
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,715
I just... I can't...

323
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,469
- I can't stop thinking about you.
- So?

324
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,930
It was a huge mistake.

325
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,476
And those drinks were free and...
And I was feeling sorry for myself,

326
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,019
and you took advantage of that.

327
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,563
I think we both took advantage of that.

328
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,360
Please, go home to your family.

329
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,366
I keep thinking about what you said
that night. About how there are...

330
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,159
shiny people who have everything,

331
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,161
and then there are people like us

332
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,372
who have to go to parties
with those people

333
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,708
and watch them get their pictures taken,
and it's not fair.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,253
Because we deserve stuff, too.

335
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,880
We deserve attention.

336
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,091
And...

337
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,300
like...

338
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:34,971
sex.

339
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,643
[both moaning]

340
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,727
Oh, my God.

341
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,645
Ruth.

342
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,981
You're... You're amazing.

343
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,023
Yeah, thank you.

344
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,026
You're so real.

345
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,444
Mm-mm.

346
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,447
You... Ow. Ah. Ha!

347
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,033
You are the most real person
that I've ever been with.

348
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,368
Okay.

349
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,497
Shh. Shh.

350
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,749
[both shushing]

351
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,673
[both moaning]

352
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,259
[Sam] Okay, over the next two days,

353
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,345
I'm gonna be casting a squad of 12 women

354
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,556
to play wrestlers on TV.

355
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,892
Based on one, can you move,

356
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,228
and can you follow basic direction?

357
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,440
And two, do I like your face,

358
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,900
- or do I not like your face?
- [murmuring]

359
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,277
All right.

360
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,447
If I call your number and say,
"Thank you,"

361
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,448
you've been cut.

362
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,285
So, dry your tears
and leave the ring quietly.

363
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,580
Now, this hulking specimen over here

364
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,290
is what...? What is it?

365
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,751
Salty "The Sack" Johnson.

366
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,712
Salty "The Sack" Johnson.
You've heard of him, right?

367
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,007
He's the two-time champion
of... some stuff.

368
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,302
All right, if you don't wanna leave here
with a broken spine,

369
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,846
I suggest you listen to what
he has to say very carefully.

370
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,473
All right, go ahead.

371
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,766
Ladies...

372
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,811
we're gonna go through the basics,
so, you need to focus.

373
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,104
You heard the big man.

374
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,523
Go ahead.

375
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,526
First up, forward rolls.

376
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,446
- [Sam] Whoa.
- Just like preschool.

377
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,282
Not like preschool.

378
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,493
Everyone off the ropes. Let's get to work.

379
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,288
[Sam] You heard him.

380
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,708
Oh, shit.

381
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,918
What... What the fuck?

382
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,795
Who even, like, watches this sport?

383
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,463
- I feel like...
- Uh, everyone.

384
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,007
Even my nani watches <i>WWF Superstars.</i>

385
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,051
She's 85, and she only speaks Hindi.

386
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,765
Okay, number 18.

387
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,350
Ugh.

388
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,977
You remind me of my ex-wife. Thanks.

389
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,607
He's already cutting people?
I thought this was just a warm-up.

390
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,361
- Better make it count, then, right?
- [Salty] Next.

391
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,072
Let's go. Come on.

392
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,453
Oof... Ah!

393
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,621
Yes.

394
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,457
Hi.

395
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,631
[Ruth exhales]

396
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,884
[sighs]

397
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,680
Attack... the ropes.

398
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,473
Do not be afraid.

399
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,313
First two, get in.

400
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,023
[Reggie] Good. All right.

401
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:33,983
Let's go.

402
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,319
[grunting]

403
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,115
Ouch. Floor girl.

404
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,909
Can't see your number... Bye.

405
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,081
Yes! Still in the fuckin' game.

406
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,208
Fuck yes!

407
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,126
[yells]

408
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,145
Oh, Christ.

409
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,981
This throw is called the hair mare.

410
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,527
[all gasp]

411
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:21,739
Exactly.

412
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,449
Let's go!

413
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,117
Your turn, ladies.

414
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,501
So, what's our backstory?

415
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:34,710
Our what?

416
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,337
What's motivating this?

417
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,840
Why are we fighting? What's...
What's driving you to come after me

418
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,718
and grab me by the hair
and throw me to the ground?

419
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:43,969
It has to be something.

420
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,429
He told us to.

421
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,225
Look, there's still a lot of girls,

422
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,561
which means anyone could be cut.
We have to go above and beyond.

423
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,979
Trust me.

424
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,066
- I'm an actress. I know what I'm doing.
- Okay.

425
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,276
- Honey.
- [chuckles]

426
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,945
The victim does all the work.

427
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,447
You just gotta tug
on my hair a little bit.

428
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,448
I'll do the rest.

429
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,080
[women gasp]

430
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,706
Nice. Good job, Cherry.

431
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,669
- Cute outfit, Pippi Longstockings.
- [chuckles]

432
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,128
[Salty] Next!

433
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,008
- [growling]
- Get off of me!

434
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,388
Creepy, but I like it.

435
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,305
Next!

436
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,189
Please!

437
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,400
I beg you!

438
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,486
I am not your enemy!

439
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,071
You stole.

440
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,656
Bread.

441
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,951
- For my family.
- What the fuck is this?

442
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,411
Just do the move.

443
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,622
We are. We are.
We're just motivating it with backstory.

444
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,793
There is a law...

445
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,379
There is a law, and you broke it.

446
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,007
And now, you will pay the ultimate price.

447
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,844
Okay, all right. That's it.
Number 30, number 22, thank you.

448
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,470
What?

449
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,598
- Why?
- What do you mean, "Why?"

450
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,350
I gave you basic direction.
You didn't follow it. You're both out.

451
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,562
There are no scenes to read,

452
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,857
no character work,
so, yes, we improvised.

453
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,275
Jesus Christ.

454
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,568
Fucking actresses.

455
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,613
All right. I'm feeling generous.

456
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,907
<i>Sophie's Choice.</i>
Why should I pick you and not her?

457
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,117
Go. Girl fight.

458
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm a real actress.

459
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,540
I will work my ass off,
and I will make you believe me

460
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,876
when I do stuff,
even if it's just hair pulling.

461
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,713
Well, that was a very nice pitch.
Very earnest. What about you?

462
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,759
My dad's Goliath Jackson.

463
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,135
Holy shit.

464
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,178
Holy shit, why?

465
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,472
He's a giant. I mean...

466
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:56,769
he's a legend in the ring,
but he's also literally... gigantic.

467
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,980
And the brothers, too.
Mighty Tom Jackson and Big Kurt Jackson.

468
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:00,939
No shit.

469
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,358
The Lumberjacksons.

470
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,360
The Lumberjacksons?

471
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,612
It's an honor to meet you.

472
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,529
Thanks.

473
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,408
Hard sell. But I'm gonna have to go
with the dynasty. You're out.

474
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,980
Why? Because my dad
was a high school science teacher

475
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:17,915
- and not some famous giant?
- Maybe.

476
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,334
Or 'cause I don't like
your face, or your ass.

477
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,794
I don't know.

478
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,546
Maybe I like both of 'em too much.
I don't...

479
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,549
I don't have to explain myself.
That's the beauty of being a director.

480
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,218
You're out.

481
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,235
[sighs]

482
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,995
Move out of my way, fuckwad!

483
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,172
What you smiling at,
you Pert Plus-looking bitch?

484
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,966
Are you guys a band or something?

485
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,176
Fuck that.
We're the Los Angeles Death Squad.

486
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,928
Fuck you, Nancy Reagan.

487
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,596
- Give me that taco!
- Hey, that's my taco!

488
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,766
[stammers] Get your own... Stop! No!

489
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,645
What? That was my lunch and my dinner,
you little assholes!

490
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,772
Fuck! No!

491
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,315
[boy] Bitch.

492
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,444
Give me my keys!
I don't care about the purse!

493
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,405
But just the... Give me my keys!
I need my keys!

494
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,253
[Debbie] Where the fuck are we?

495
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,592
You got jumped by a bunch of children?

496
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,385
No. No.

497
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:54,303
They were...

498
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,804
teenagers.

499
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,557
They weren't, like...
They were almost teenage...

500
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,100
They were... They were small,

501
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:04,188
but they were feral. They were,
you know, not well-cared for.

502
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,105
It was...

503
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,775
It was very scary.

504
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,277
It sounds so scary.

505
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,405
Fuck.

506
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,491
My apartment key. Fuck.

507
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,494
Don't swear in front of Randy.

508
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,287
I'm sorry.

509
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,663
I'm sorry.

510
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,248
Hi.

511
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:26,960
I'm kidding. Of course you can swear
in front of him. He's a fucking baby.

512
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,089
And I think I still have a spare key
to your apartment in my bag.

513
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:32,466
- No.
- Yes.

514
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,759
You still have that key?

515
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,512
Oh!

516
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,305
Oh, thank God.

517
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,736
Oh, God. Mark had food poisoning

518
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,405
in that photo from poke.

519
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,159
Lost three pounds, though. Fat fuck.

520
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,494
- Huh.
- Yeah.

521
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,248
You wanna come over for dinner?

522
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,251
No, I can't. I have a scene study class.

523
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,253
Really? You're still going to that?

524
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,924
[sighs] [in Southern accent] Brick.

525
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,178
How much longer does this have to go on?
