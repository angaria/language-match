00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:03,967
We immediately
suspend your license.

3
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,171
You can't fire me
because of this.

4
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,472
Without a license,
your tenure gets nullified.

5
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:08,805
You're an alcoholic.

6
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,009
No, the problem is
you're a little bitch!

7
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,641
Get help.

8
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,975
My name is Annalise Keating,
and I'm an alcoholic.

9
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:14,951
Nate?

10
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:15,949
You don't know how long

11
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,050
I've been wanting this
to happen.

12
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,381
My father's dead.

13
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,286
I lied.
My father found Frank.

14
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,517
He's in Coalport.

15
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,692
He killed your father.

16
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,320
Don't tell Annalise.

17
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:26,685
Dr. Lowell!
She's pregnant.

18
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:27,834
Oh, my God.

19
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,358
I know her.

20
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,400
sign of hydrops

21
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,795
Good.

22
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:40,166
And what's taking
the O.B. so long?

23
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,474
Page down to plastics.

24
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,175
We need to debride these burns.
Do they not know that?

25
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,920
There is some concern
with smoke inhalation.

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,850
Uh. What does that mean?
Is she gonna die?

27
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,855
Okay, you need
to keep your voice down, okay?

28
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,857
I could get in a lot of trouble
for even telling you this.

29
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,029
I just want to make sure
she's okay.

30
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,227
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,058
I know,
and I promise you,

32
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,234
I'm gonna tell you
everything I can, okay?

33
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,532
H-Have you thought about
contacting the others?

34
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,865
No. What am I --

35
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,339
I wanted to make sure
we had more information...

36
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:12,668
Hi.

37
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,342
I'm here.
Just don't worry.

38
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,913
I know. I'm on it.

39
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,612
Please try to trust me.

40
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,783
Laurel's pregnant.

41
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,621
We're happy to plan
whatever you like.

42
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,263
The funeral, flowers,
any burial services.

43
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,389
That won't be
necessary.

44
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,863
Do you need a moment?

45
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,425
No.

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,820
Cremate him.

47
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:57,717
Of course.

48
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,988
Just are you in town
for a bit?

49
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:03,057
You could pick up the ashes,
or we could mail them.

50
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,128
Can anyone see you calling me
right now?

51
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,501
No, I'm in my car.

52
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:12,499
Where are you?

53
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,100
Leaving the funeral home.

54
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,071
Oh. How was it?

55
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,299
Lovely.

56
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,243
Stupid question.
Sorry.

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,839
Have you seen Frank?

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,110
No.

59
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,338
You'll call me
when you do?

60
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,114
<i> If</i> I do.

61
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,352
I'll call you later.

62
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,596
Thank you.

63
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,867
So, Meggy wants to have

64
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,375
a buttload of your babies,
basically?
No.

65
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,108
Mm. You better start saving
for a ring.

66
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,013
Personally, I think anything
under three karats

67
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,475
is a red flag.

68
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:03,823
What are you guys
talking about?

69
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,777
Waitlist is meeting Meggy's
parents tonight.

70
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,816
Her father's in town.
We're just having dinner.

71
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:08,791
Oh, that's a big deal.

72
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,859
-It's not.
-It is.

73
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,887
And you need to dump her
before this goes bad.

74
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,192
Meggy's amazing.
Why would he break up with her?

75
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,225
None of us at this table
are fit to date civilians.

76
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,530
That's ridiculous.

77
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,701
No, what's ridiculous is you
dating doughnut-hole here

78
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,330
when the only thing you guys
have in common is murder.

79
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,995
Can we not talk about this
right here?

80
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,503
Maybe I should date
Waitlist.

81
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,135
Or Laurel.
Or we could be a throuple.

82
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,640
I mean, that makes just about
as much sense as you two boning.

83
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,842
Actually, technically,

84
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,043
my hotness and I
are not boning right now.

85
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,135
I'm pulling
a "Bull Durham"

86
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,476
until the arbitration
exam's over.

87
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,980
Hey, guys,
I got a trade opportunity.

88
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,082
Dumbass Gavin over there

89
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,923
hasn't even started
the evidence outline.

90
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,948
Any of you be willing to trade
for my arbitration outline?

91
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,751
Uh...yeah.
I'm doing our evidence outline.

92
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,086
I can get it to you
by Monday

93
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,921
Great.

94
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,586
Did you actually do
the reading for evidence?

95
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:48,985
No, and I didn't
for this exam either,

96
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,096
so I'm just gonna --
Oh, my God.

97
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,157
What is that?

98
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,395
Uh...
it's a xeroxed ass.

99
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,829
My ass!

100
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,534
Does that
turn you on, Walsh?

101
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,196
This is
sexual harassment.

102
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,674
Why don't you go
tattletale to Mommy then?

103
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,412
Oh, that's right.
She's still suspended.

104
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:09,106
But your
assistant called and canceled.

105
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,546
I'm so over her.

106
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,752
That's the third time
she canceled at the last minute.

107
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,354
I told her
not to come back.

108
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,616
I ain't trying to deal
with anyone.

109
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,124
Hey, Camila, I get it.

110
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,755
That's right.

111
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,260
It's because of your mouth.

112
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,562
What my mouth got to do
with anything?

113
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,203
You've got a loud mouth.

114
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,228
Don't be dealing with that
all the time.

115
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,732
That's true.

116
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,904
Miss Annalise,
can I get you some champagne?

117
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,869
She's a little lost
in her own world today.

118
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,971
Ain't that right, Annalise?

119
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,243
I'm sorry.

120
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,941
Yvonne asked you if you wanted
something to drink.

121
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,143
You look
like you need it.

122
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,214
We got champagne.

123
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,412
Cheap champagne.
I do not recommend it.

124
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,754
I'm trying to cut back.

125
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,049
Why?
You pregnant?

126
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,620
Oh, please. My eggs dried up
a long time ago.

127
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,289
Then you can't use your period
as an excuse

128
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,718
for this mood you in.

129
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,662
What's wrong? You finally
screw up with the cop?

130
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,718
Since when has my mood
been dependent on a man?

131
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,386
Ooh, does that mean
you done with him?

132
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,125
There she go.
Queen of THOT-land.

133
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,500
Y'all know my radar
perks up

134
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,399
when the conversation
turns to fine-ass sexy men.

135
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,672
If you're talking
about that same guy

136
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,270
that you showed me
in that picture one day,

137
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,301
then I want first dibs.

138
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,636
I got him next.

139
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,240
Ooh, honey, I would love
to take them --

140
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,782
You'd love to what?

141
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,177
Be with a man
who don't cry after sex.

142
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,079
You know what? That's why
I don't tell you nothing, Ro.

143
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,252
Wait. You want to know
what your problem is, Professor?

144
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,681
You're too greedy.

145
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,286
First you're not happy
with the white man,

146
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,817
now you're not happy
with the black man.

147
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,692
Better than being sloppy
like some people I know,

148
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,361
sleeping with their husband's
friends.

149
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,859
But see, it worked,
didn't it?

150
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,490
I found out Tyler
was screwing our neighbor.

151
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,125
Heffa, everyone knew
your husband

152
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,430
was sleeping
with the neighbor.

153
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:32,932
Well,
how come no one told me?

154
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,103
We did!
We did!                  We did!

155
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,271
See, that's messed up.

156
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,539
What's up, ladies?

157
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,337
Oh, no! Gone, gone!
You know the rules. Out!

158
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,610
We don't want your stuff.

159
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,837
I told his druggy behind
not to come in here anymore.

160
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,843
Y'all know he harmless.
He just down on his luck.

161
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,346
For the last 10 years?

162
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,178
Well, it took me 14
to get my ass clean.

163
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,783
Clean from what?

164
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,654
Oh, Ro didn't tell you
about her crack-den days?

165
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,693
It was cocaine mostly.

166
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,658
Rick wasn't playing when he said
it was a hell of a drug.

167
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,817
But I did the work,

168
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,025
used God and sex
to make me feel good,

169
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,327
throw some AA meetings in there,
and I'm good to go.

170
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,799
She still drinks.

171
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,227
It was that one time.

172
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,702
If you mean by "one time"

173
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,970
every Tuesday and Thursday
down at Jazzy C's...

174
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,528
Why'd you do it?

175
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,835
Which part?

176
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,640
You think this is funny?

177
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,981
Annalise would kill me
if she knew I was here, Frank.

178
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,038
Mm, take a number.

179
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,346
She's probably got
another hit man

180
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,707
on his way here
right now.

181
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,375
I don't blame her
for that.

182
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,189
You shot Mahoney while Wes
was standing right there.

183
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,262
Why?

184
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,102
What? You didn't?

185
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,727
Somebody else
just happened to shoot him?

186
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,004
It was me.

187
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,503
Why take Wes?

188
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,205
I needed to know
she wasn't gonna come after me.

189
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,750
You made him a suspect.
That is why she came after you.

190
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,518
Maybe Sam
was wrong about me.

191
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,551
Don't say that.

192
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,716
None of this
would've ever happened

193
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,625
if they just left me
in there.

194
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,300
Get up.

195
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,706
Why?

196
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,607
'Cause we're
gonna beat your ass.

197
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,150
Kidding.
You got a visitor.

198
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,491
Who the hell are you?

199
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,059
Dr. Keating.

200
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,855
Sit.

201
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,798
Your Aunt Bev knows my sister
Hannah from high school.

202
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,628
She was saying
how worried your family is,

203
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,804
that nobody's
heard from you.

204
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,973
You don't want them
to visit?

205
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,242
I'm in solitary.

206
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,270
Yeah,
but that was before.

207
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,405
You haven't spoken
to your parents

208
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,480
in -- what -- a few months?

209
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,950
Okay, look, I've worked
with a lot of people

210
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,819
in your
similar situation.

211
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,277
Sociopaths?

212
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,515
You've been incarcerated
since you were 13, Frank.

213
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,752
There's tons of research

214
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,756
to show how that
impacts family dynamics.

215
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,388
Good to know.

216
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,360
Truth?

217
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,626
Your parents told me
you were up for parole.

218
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,665
And they want to do
whatever they can

219
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,169
to get you out of here.

220
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,101
I even have
a lawyer for a wife

221
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:30,036
who I believe
can win your case.

222
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:34,453
And I can see it in you, too.
Frank -- you want out of here.

223
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,518
Let me
help get you there.

224
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,160
Threatening a guard,
assaulting an inmate,

225
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,657
and that's on top
of attempted murder?

226
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,889
Here's what I think.

227
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,034
You need to say "No"
to your sister

228
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,399
for once in your life.

229
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,057
So...I take it
that's a no?

230
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,825
Well, if you want me
to take a case pro bono,

231
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:58,265
how about not a white boy
who has violent tendencies?

232
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,481
What?

233
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,849
Well,
how is this different

234
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,847
than you asking me
to help Bonnie?

235
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,579
Bonnie didn't try
to kill her father.

236
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,054
She might've
if we hadn't helped her.

237
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,322
That's a reach.

238
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,550
Just -- Just hear me out.

239
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,715
He's poor,
and his family's hurting.

240
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:21,164
What's the harm
in just going to see him?

241
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,998
Don't get up.

242
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,229
Before we start,
let me be blunt.

243
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,340
The only way I see you
getting out

244
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,868
is if you admit guilt.

245
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,713
I don't care if it's not true,
if it was an accident.

246
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,539
You got to say
you did it on purpose.

247
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,284
Do I need
to repeat myself?

248
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,109
No, it's just
you're not what I expected.

249
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,415
What does that mean?

250
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,947
Your husband's
kind of vanilla.

251
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:46,953
And...?

252
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,694
You seem
the opposite of vanilla.

253
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,219
Neither of us
are vanilla.

254
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,693
-You guys got kids?
-Trying.

255
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,262
What's the problem?
His junk not work?

256
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,430
Sexual advance
on a female guard,

257
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,059
inciting a fight
in your cellblock.

258
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,434
Only a moron commits
these kinds of infractions

259
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,903
when you're up for parole.

260
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,401
Or you just don't want out
at all?

261
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,774
Which is it?

262
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,581
I've always been
kind of a moron.

263
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,326
Don't worry.
I'm not looking.

264
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,404
Your phone rang.

265
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,668
Laurel?

266
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,513
No.

267
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,286
You sure
you don't want the ashes?

268
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,087
I mean, we can cook them
into slop,

269
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,019
feed it to pigs,

270
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,164
or just spread them

271
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,858
in the worst place
imaginable.

272
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,430
My sister
might actually take them.

273
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,828
Oh, so your sister
showed up?

274
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,529
Yeah, she's here now.

275
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,971
Oh, then go.
I'll talk to you later.

276
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,267
It's fine.

277
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,368
-How are you?
-Great.

278
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,500
I have the whole house
to myself this weekend.

279
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,506
I'm gonna eat
and watch bad movies.

280
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,168
You still have the list
of AA meetings

281
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,606
I left on your desk?

282
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,381
Bonnie, just go and be
with your sister.

283
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,279
Thanks.

284
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,857
God, grant me the serenity

285
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,329
to accept the things
I cannot change,

286
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,359
courage to change
the things I can,

287
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,366
and wisdom to know
the difference.

288
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,669
Hi, I'm Jonathan.
I'm an alcoholic.

289
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,171
Hi, Jonathan.

290
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,043
Any visitors here
for the first time today?

291
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,353
Hi.

292
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,517
We usually start
by saying our names.

293
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,877
Do I have to?

294
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,361
Annalise.

295
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,088
Hi, Annalise.

296
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:11,395
Thank you
for joining us today, Annalise.

297
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,402
"Once Middleton was made aware
of the circumstances,

298
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,765
the office of the President
immediately began a review.

299
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,584
As a result, Professor Keating's
duties have been reassigned.

300
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,537
A new instructor
has been assigned

301
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,775
to the Legal Clinic
effective immediately."

302
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,581
Ding-dong,
the bitch is dead.

303
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,023
Can they do this?
Of course.

304
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,347
She pushed too far.

305
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,552
Or they couldn't handle
having a strong woman in power.

306
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,454
Power only works
if you know how to not abuse it.

307
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,286
Okay, we need to storm
the President's office,

308
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,761
do an "Oh, Captain!
My Captain!"

309
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,530
Maybe this just means
we're finally free.

310
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,788
Free of what?

311
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,296
Her.

312
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,697
This is bad, isn't it?

313
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,969
She'll figure something out.
She always does.

314
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,938
I-I could be out of a job,
and I really like this job.

315
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,967
Poor Annalise.

316
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,212
Had to figure I'd run
into someone I know

317
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,380
at one of these
sooner or later.

318
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,878
Professor Erickson?

319
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,310
You think he could do
a better job than me?

320
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,315
I don't think this
is the place to discuss this.

321
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,717
I don't care
what you think.

322
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,649
I'm at this meeting
in order to get my license back.

323
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,724
Is that the only reason
you're here?

324
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,493
I'll sue you.
Remind your board of that.

325
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,391
You think
there's a chance in hell

326
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,493
they would've suspended you

327
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,064
if they thought
you had a legitimate case?

328
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,430
Unbelievable.

329
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,231
You know what?
Stop fighting, Annalise.

330
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,304
It's not cute anymore.

331
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,665
Come home with me.

332
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,065
What?

333
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,306
She needs
to hear you say it --

334
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,852
that Sam forced you
to keep it from her.

335
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,480
I could've told her,
anyway.

336
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,717
You couldn't...

337
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,987
...because Sam
got into your head...

338
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,034
just like he did
to me.

339
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,630
This is a woman
who wants me dead.

340
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,433
Because she blames you
for the baby,

341
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,835
and that's fair.

342
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,598
You know that.

343
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,506
Of course I do.

344
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,508
Then come home
and tell her that.

345
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,882
She'll forgive you.

346
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,851
You just need
to forgive her first.

347
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,238
He was lying to me
in there.

348
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,413
Why? That's your job
to figure out,

349
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,540
but plenty of people
prefer a life on the inside.

350
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,506
Someone feeds you,

351
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:41,513
tells you where to be
all the time.

352
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,554
Sounds nice to me.

353
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,679
Doesn't make any sense,
though.

354
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,053
And yet,
that's what he's doing.

355
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,181
Commits crimes in jail

356
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,686
so he doesn't have to deal
with the real world.

357
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,687
My job is hard enough
dealing with people

358
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,259
who actually want
to be out.

359
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,988
He wants out.
He's just...

360
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,163
confused.

361
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,201
Come on, tell me you didn't see
what I saw -- the wounded --

362
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,957
I think you saw a boy
in need of a daddy.

363
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,737
That's not fair.

364
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,109
Well, neither is guilting me
into being a mother.

365
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,437
That's not
what this is about.

366
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,941
Everything coming out
of your mouth right now

367
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,213
is about that.

368
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,241
You're reaching,
and you know it.

369
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,575
When's the last time
you touched me?

370
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,711
Ever since I said no
to IVF,

371
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,216
I'm not enough for you --
is that it?

372
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,848
Annie --
You can't stand the idea

373
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,623
of being stuck all alone
in this house with me.

374
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,021
Okay, hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.

375
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,585
Come here.

376
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,804
You're all I need.

377
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,569
And if I haven't made you
feel that way...

378
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,938
I'm sorry.

379
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,197
You...

380
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,435
are enough for me.

Well, for now.

430
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,338

What are you
talking about?

443
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,574
One of you took my laptop.
Give it back.

444
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:57,769
-Ooh, this is good.
-This isn't funny!

445
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,940
Unwad your panties,
bro.

446
00:18:58,938 --> 00:18:59,838
I went to the bathroom.
It was right there.

447
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,939
I came back,
and it was gone,

448
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,070
and I will call security
if I have to.

449
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,735
-I dare you.
-Ain't afraid of no po-po.

450
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,943
Okay, open your bag then
and prove you don't have it.
Hey!

451
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,345
It is illegal to do
an unlawful search and seizure

452
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,807
of someone's belongings.

453
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,305
This isn't funny.
That computer was expensive

454
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,416
and I don't have money to blow

455
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,517
like the rest
of your spoiled asses.

456
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,419
-Spoiled?
-Oh, you think we don't know

457
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,650
that you're just here
playing at law school

458
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,685
until you can swap
a rich daddy

459
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:17,359
for a rich husband?

460
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,457
Go anywhere near my bag

461
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,618
or anyone else's
in this room

462
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,986
and your laptop
won't be all you're missing,

463
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,334
you spineless, tiny-balled,
whiny excuse of a man!

464
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,832
Walk away.

465
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,784
So, Wes, where you from?

466
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,510
Ohio originally, but I, uh,
I moved around a lot.

467
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,546
Oh. Army brat?

468
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,021
Uh, Dad, can you just
let him eat?

469
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,449
This is not
an interrogation.

470
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,194
All right,
maybe just a little bit.

471
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,990
I get it.
But, no, not an Army brat.

472
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,992
So, what do
your parents do?
Dad.

473
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,464
How is that
not a fair question?

474
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:02,768
Wes' mom died of cancer
and he never met his father.

475
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,369
I apologize.

476
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,744
It was
a really long time ago.

477
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:10,682
What kind of cancer?

478
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,237
Oh, my God.

479
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,245

00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,299
And maybe
I don't have to go back.

514
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:15,898
Maybe neither of us do.

515
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,937
Run away with me.

516
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,381
You're not happy in that house.
Nobody ever is.

517
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:30,978
But you...out of all of us
deserve to be.

518
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:34,023
Find some boring town.

519
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,890
Get normal jobs.

520
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,564
Make a family.

521
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,661
We'd have cute babies, no?

522
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,636
I'm only teasing.

523
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:01,105
You mind
if I turn on the TV?

524
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,550
Go ahead.

525
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,651
<i>Everything </i>

526
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,752
<i> you know, life escalates.</i>

527
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:11,485
<i> But when you're young,</i>
<i>love, life is very complicated.</i>

528
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:16,658
My wife's a hard sell,
Frank,

529
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,002
but her bull detector's
pretty good.

530
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,727
But I think I can get her back
to your side.

531
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,332
Yeah, you did your best.
Don't worry about it.

532
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,434
I do worry, though.

533
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,539
You're scared to get out.

534
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,671
No, that's stupid.

535
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,336
Then why do you keep screwing up
in here?

536
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:37,445
Because the only reason
I can think of

537
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,480
is that you can't forgive
yourself for what you did.

538
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,247
It was an accident, Frank.

539
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:50,727
My parents tell you that?

540
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,360
"No way he could've pulled that
lever himself."

541
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,874
He took the TV
out of my room...

542
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:05,414
yelled at me when I didn't
help out around the house,

543
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:08,881
as a dad should do.

544
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:13,981
And still, I thought it was
worth killing the guy over.

545
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,486
You were 13.

546
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:16,788
You didn't know
what you were doing.

547
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,119
I planned it for weeks.

548
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,226
Waited for
the perfect moment.

549
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,128
Looked forward to it.

550
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,230
And when it was over
and he was under that car,

551
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:32,073
screaming like an animal
in a trap,

552
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:37,511
my only thought was,
"You idiot, Frank.

553
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,750
You couldn't even kill him
right."

554
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:46,217
Now tell me
I should get out of here.

555
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,694
You should.

556
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:53,119
Then you're even more
of a sociopath than I am.

557
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,985
Sociopaths don't cry
over what they did, Frank.

558
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,097
Hey.

559
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:04,799
You have good in you. Okay?
Just like all of us.

560
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:08,544
And I'm here
to finally help you see that.

561
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,741
You have good in you.

562
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,115
Wake up.

563
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:31,195
Sorry.

564
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,997
It's okay.

565
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,101
Your dad?

566
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:53,145
How about Oregon?

567
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:58,522
They have these beach towns
with giant sand dunes and trees,

568
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,894
and it rains a lot, too,

569
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:05,503
so we won't feel bad
if we stay inside all the time.

570
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:10,728
And when it's nice,
we can go for hikes.

571
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,436
Can't imagine you on a hike.

572
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,668
That's the point.

573
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:19,382
We'd do things
that make us forget.

574
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,805
...but
the 4th Circuit's opinion found

575
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,283
Rule 17-A applies
to only those asserting a claim,

576
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,152
that people can sue
whoever they want,

577
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,251
so why did the Supreme Court
find in favor of the respondent

578
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:37,354
in Vaden v. Discover Bank?

579
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,086
Castillo.

580
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,832
What was the question?

581
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,627
Ms. Vaden failed
to disprove the presumption

582
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,929
that she received a binding
arbitration clause in the mail,

583
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,501
and therefore agreed
to the contract.

584
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,700
Now say it
with a Southern twang.

585
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,101
What are you talking about?

586
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,702
Your hillbilly came out when
you were bitching out Simon.

587
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,144
It did not.
It did.

588
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,169
It was pretty thick.

589
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,673
It happens in sex sometimes,
too, P.S.

590
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:56,635
So, I can never quite
put my finger on it.

591
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,942
It's like a cross between,
like,

592
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,513
Louisiana alligator wrestling

593
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,112
and Georgian peach picker.

594
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,953
We just broke up.

595
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,955

Come on.

599
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:19,727
Come on in. Ooh.

600
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,672
Dance with me, Wes.

601
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,567
Ooh!

00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,799

610
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:42,923
What's wrong?

611
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:45,022
I thought you weren't
supposed to be drinking.

612
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,494
Oh.

613
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:49,392
There's a lot of things
I'm not supposed to be doing.

614
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:53,495

618
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,707

619
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:10,353
Everything okay?
<i> Like I need to tell you.</i>

620
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,379
Family drama.

621
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,724
I know how that goes.

622
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,521
Oh.

623
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:20,623
Every woman in my office
would stone me

624
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:24,026
if they found
where I was right now.

625
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,259
You can't tell anyone
about us.

626
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,395
Oh, we are consenting
adults, Nate.

627
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,401
I'm serious.

628
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,803
Didn't turn out so well
last time I slept with a lawyer.

629
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:37,306
Oh, let's be clear --
I'm no Annalise Keating.

630
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,609
You heard that woman's calling
herself an alcoholic now, right?

631
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,083
That's how she's getting out
of her suspension.

632
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,483
It'll probably work, too.

633
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,785
That's how life rolls
for that woman.

634
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:51,888
The lady's got nine lives.

635
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,418
You got to see this.

636
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,426
What are you doing here?

637
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,487
I asked Oliver for a favor.

638
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,726
What kind of favor?
I hacked Simon's laptop.

639
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,902
You stole his computer?
Nope, that was me.

640
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,271
Michaela.
You're insane.

641
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,639
Who are you? Seriously.

642
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:05,837
You some sort of hillbilly
klepto all of a sudden?

643
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:06,798
Okay, you're all gonna be happy
I did this

644
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,236
when we get
his arbitration outline.

645
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,810
Couldn't find the outline.
Check again.

646
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,609
I found something better.

647
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,779
Oh, my God.
What the --

648
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,510
I knew it.

649
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,424
Here.

650
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,504
Here.

651
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,369
Listen.

652
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:50,312
So much for
that 100% Indian hair.

653
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,723
Go!

654
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:00,955
Go away.

655
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,790
Go away!

656
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:03,785
Just --
No.

657
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:06,626
I'm dis-- I'm disgusting!

658
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,402
I'm disgusting.
No. Here.

659
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,908
You shot me.

660
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,007
You wanted me dead.

661
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,814
I saw it in your eyes.
You hate me.

662
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,053
You hate me.

663
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,047
That's not true.

664
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,719
You protect me.

665
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,288
And I just want to do
the same for you.

666
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,845
Ohh.

667
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,771
How's -- How's Meggy?

668
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:45,197
Huh? Huh?

669
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:46,774
Is she good to you?

670
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,007
Very.

671
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,379
Oh.

672
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,577
Too good?

673
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:58,617
'Cause Nate's too good
to me.

674
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,117
I tried to be okay with it.

675
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,792
I really did.

676
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,690
I really did.

677
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,199
No.

678
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:34,751
You need some water?

679
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:50,965
Parole cases
are time-consuming and tedious,

680
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,470
but my husband seems to like you
for some reason,

681
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,171
and I tend to think
that my husband has good taste.

682
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:55,973
He picked me, after all.

683
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,235
So, if I help you,
you can't lie to me again.

684
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,583
Understood?
Yeah.

685
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,954
Okay, you got yourself
a lawyer.

686
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,850
Now, we need to go over
the details

687
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:09,352
of what happened
to your father, all right?

688
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,985
I got the police report
right here.

689
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,731
I need to...

690
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:19,904
You okay?

691
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,200
You need to tell me
your side of the story.

692
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,536
Spare no details.

693
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:41,348
You pregnant or something?

694
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,360
Boy, right?
How'd you know?

695
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,430
Don't marry a lawyer.

696
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:53,363
Take him!

697
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,137
I just had a feeling it was him.

698
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,839
He's always so aggro
about you

699
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,040
and that he's never gotten
to be first chair,

700
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,672
and -- and with your job
on the line,

701
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:07,536
I just thought maybe I should
just look through his computer.

702
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,806
She stole his computer
for the arbitration outline.

703
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,815
We can't give it to
the university, though, right?

704
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,177
Otherwise they'll know
that Michaela stole it.

705
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,375
I can lie, say I found it
somewhere in the quad.

706
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,916
No one's ever gonna believe
that.

707
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:19,361
No one has to lie.
I'm not gonna show it to anyone.

708
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:20,818
You're just gonna let him
get away with this?

709
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:23,556
I didn't say that.
Go and prep for your exam.

710
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,662
What are you gonna do?
Make that weenball pay.

711
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:27,563
Honestly, you sure?
Yeah.

712
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,526
I mean, the D.A.'s office
could've put these up

713
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:30,695
or anyone who knows
what we've done,

714
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:31,872
but it wasn't any of them.

715
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,670
It was just some sad,
pathetic lost boy.

716
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:38,513
We're safe.
We're still safe.

717
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,394
Mind if I come in?
What's going on?

718
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,889
Stop!
What are you doing here?

719
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,490
I came to return this.

720
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,231
Somebody put that there,
planted it.

721
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,430
Don't lie to me!

722
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,797
Slander, defamation,

723
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,972
hate crime if you want
to bring race into it,

724
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:09,471
and it all leads to your
expulsion or worse -- prison!

725
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:13,844
What are you gonna do?

726
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,775
That's up to you.

727
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,422
Mr. Gibbins,
give us an example

728
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:25,491
of procedural versus
substantive unconscionability.

729
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:28,591
Uh...it was
unconscionable 'cause --

730
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,634
Wrong. Mr. Millstone?

731
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,129
I object, Your Honor.

732
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,001
I object to the question,
I object to your tone,

733
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,469
and I object
that we don't have

734
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,067
a cool pitcher of
sweet, home-brewed lemonade

735
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:38,739
to get us through
these proceedings.
Are you done?

736
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,497
Do you think
it's more of, like, a --

737
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:43,966
like a BeyoncÃ© Southern
or a "Deliverance" Southern?

738
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,606
We have an exam tomorrow.
Come on,

739
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:46,681
just tell us
where your accent's from.

740
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,078
Is it your birth parents
or adopted parents?

741
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,310
It's none of your business.

742
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,754
Uh, we're boning.
I think it's my business.

743
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,519
The people who raised me
are trash.

744
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:53,978
I am who I am
not because of them

745
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,416
but in spite of them.

746
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,090
They are not worth my breath
or time,

747
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:58,419
especially when
we have an exam,

748
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,193
so let's never speak
of them again

749
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,332
or I'll cut you all
into little pieces.

750
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,527
Hey.

751
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:06,857
It's the arbitration outline.

752
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,527
We good now?

753
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,441
What the hell
just happened?

754
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,439
I don't know.
Does it matter?

755
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,381
I'm gonna go make copies.

756
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,557
What's wrong?

757
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,468
I need to break up
with Meggy.

758
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:47,474
Dinner with her dad
went that well?

759
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,577
I'm sick of lying to her.

760
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,623
Think I should stay
with her?

761
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,428
No. Do what you want.

762
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,102
We're all so messed up.

763
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,400
Annalise, especially.

764
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,641
But you...

765
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:28,084
I'll break up with Meggy.

766
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,810
Frank's gone.

767
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,391
Frank isn't gone.

768
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,942
Frank?

769
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,068
Hi.

770
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,173
I wanted you and your board
to have a chance

771
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,775
to review my lawsuit
before I file.

772
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:35,578
Retaliation by the university
for speaking my mind,

773
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,350
gender, race,
age discrimination,

774
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,749
a hostile work environment,

775
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,350
wanton breach of contract,
neglect.

776
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:43,092
Neglect?
The fliers.

777
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,118
It's been weeks, and your
investigation has found nothing.

778
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,763
Instead, you've devoted
university resources

779
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,129
to having me disbarred,

780
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,957
the legality of which is
questionable in its own right.

781
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,303
$50 million?

782
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:55,498
Go big or go home.

783
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:02,966
What do you want?

784
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:05,484
A truce.
Reverse my suspension.

785
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,207
I go back to teaching
the clinic.

786
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,712
You still don't have
your license --
That's being taken care of.

787
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:10,384
Because you went
to one AA meeting?

788
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:11,882
This is not up
for negotiation.

789
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,323
Either give me
what I want

790
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:16,148
or wake up tomorrow to a lawsuit
that will color the entirety

791
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,364
of your short run
as university president.

792
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,863
Fine, I'll make the calls
right now.

793
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,232
Thank you.

794
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,095
Annalise.

795
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:34,036
How are you? Really.

796
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:43,354
You can't get better alone.

797
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:47,018
Believe me, I've tried...

798
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,618
and failed enough times
to know.

799
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,628
Make those calls.

800
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,225
Stop, please.
At least let me warn Bonnie.

801
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:05,195
Bonnie lied.
Fine, then you tell her.

802
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,703
I just -- I can't.

803
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:11,606
Oh, I'm not in the mood
to see your needy faces.

804
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,010
Laurel needs to tell you
something.

805
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,681
She can't speak
for herself?

806
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,609
That's not the Laurel I know,
letting a man speak for her.

807
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:17,605
Please just listen.

808
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,176
All right.

809
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,154
Fine. What?

810
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:25,686
Say something.

811
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,185
It's about Frank.

812
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,458
What?

813
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:33,133
He's in Coalport
with Bonnie.

814
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,933
He called me
when I was with my dad,

815
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,695
and he told me
that you tried to kill him.

816
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:41,073
Is it true? Did you?
Is that true?

817
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:43,442
Can you tell us the truth
for once?

818
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,042
Laurel.

819
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,288
I'm here.

820
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,318
I know. I'm on it.

821
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,223
Please try to trust me.

822
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,534
Laurel's pregnant.

823
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:09,132
I had no idea.

824
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,574
Just stay here, okay?

825
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,399
I promise
I'll keep you updated.

826
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:14,474
I'll be right back.
Okay.

827
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:28,485
Pick up.
Please pick up.

828
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,187
Please pick up, please pick up,
please pick up.

829
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:33,058
<i>This is Connor.</i>
<i> You should text me.</i>

830
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,303
Connor, pick up, please.

831
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,495
Please pick --
<i>Hello?</i>

832
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,471
Who's this?
<i> Trishelle. Who's this?</i>

833
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,369
Oliver. Were --

834
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,141
I'm looking for Connor Walsh.

835
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,639
Is that
whose phone this is?

836
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,441
I just found it
in my daughter's sofa cushions.

837
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,343
Darn thing was vibrating
my booty.

838
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,805
Mom!

839
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,953
Someone named Oliver
looking for Connor.

840
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,348
I don't know where he is,
Oliver.

841
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,950
Are you sure?
<i> Yeah, what's wrong?</i>

842
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,821
<i> You haven't heard?</i>
Heard what?

843
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,320
<i> Annalise's house burned down.</i>
<i> The cops arrested her.</i>

844
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,522
<i> Laurel was inside,</i>
<i> but they found her.</i>

845
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:06,824
What?

846
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:09,385
<i> She's pregnant, Michaela.</i>

847
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:10,994
<i> Laurel.</i>

848
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,296
Did she tell you?

849
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,652
Congratulations.

850
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,520
You've each been chosen for my
very first criminal-law clinic.

851
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,320
In here,
you're not just students

852
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:13,863
but actual practicing lawyers.

853
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,328
You finally get to be me.

855
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,101

a good photo.

<i>...brace yourself for a mystery</i>
<i> so killer...</i>

857
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,695
