1
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:27,361
I'm thinking we'll go do the show,
and then we'll go get...

2
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,088
If you want to do a slice,
we'll get a slice.

3
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,157
- I'll do a slice if I can get a fountain...
- Let's go in here.

4
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:35,285
Do they have fountain soda?
'Cause I don't like cans.

5
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,496
Yeah, this is it.

6
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,039
- I love it, yeah.
- Yeah, right.

7
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,460
But my point is, if I got an indoor
ball... a woman's ball...

8
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,213
and I was at the top of the key,
I'd sink more threes.

9
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,716
Yeah, but we're not allowed
at that Y anymore.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,677
No, but I'm saying if...

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,973
Look, you don't have... You can go
in disguises to any place you want,

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,350
if you know what you're doing
on the hard court.

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,019
- I'm nervous about tonight.
- Why?

14
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,438
'Cause we're filming it for the TV thing.

15
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,566
I don't care. I'm gonna get high before...

16
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,778
<i>♪ Tonight when I chase the Dragon ♪</i>

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,158
- It's show time!
- It's show time!

18
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,831
[announcer] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to the Lyceum Theater.</i>

19
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,624
<i>Unfortunately at this performance,</i>

20
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,419
<i>the roles of Gil Faizon
and George St. Geegland</i>

21
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,047
<i>will be played by Gil Faizon
and George St. Geegland.</i>

22
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,466
Let's do Broadway.

23
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,261
I'll see you after the show.

24
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,513
So fucking dumb.

25
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,813
<i>And now, please welcome,
Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland.</i>

26
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,151
[applause]

27
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,413
Oh, hey! I know you.

28
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,335
[both] Oh, hello.

29
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,339
- Charmed I'm sure, I'm Gil Faizon
- And I am George St. Geegland.

30
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,466
And we are two legendary bachelors

31
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,718
who live on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan.

32
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,221
Which is the coffee breath
of neighborhoods.

33
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,892
We want to give a shout-out
to the mezzanine and the balcony!

34
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,685
[applause]

35
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,984
You guys are the reason we do this show!

36
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,197
But we will be making eye contact
solely with the orchestra.

37
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,992
We are gonna have so much fun tonight

38
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,871
because theater is the hot,
new thing right now.

39
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:47,000
There's <i>Hamilton </i>and no other examples.

40
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,836
Now, speaking of theater being hot,

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,547
you'll notice that we are filming
the show tonight.

42
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,509
Yes. You see cameras all over the place.

43
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:01,723
We're filming this as a special
for Investigation Discovery.

44
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,309
No, it's for Netflix.

45
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,560
It's a binge-watch.

46
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,189
It's a binge-watch. You watch an episode
of a show, then you wait a week,

47
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,983
and then you binge-watch another episode.

48
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,236
Also, if you see a camera,

49
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,198
you know, look right down
the barrel of the lens, all right?

50
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,786
And you know, we're trying to convey
that we have a diverse audience,

51
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,039
so if you're white, tonight,
if you could just not be.

52
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,207
Yeah!

53
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,291
[audience laugh]

54
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,502
All right, that covers the business.

55
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,922
We want to also give a shout-out
to our dear intern Ravi in the booth.

56
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,550
Shout-out to Ravi!

57
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,469
OK. This is Ravi.

58
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:43,056
Ravi is a junior at the
NYU Tisch School for the Arts.

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,350
Yes, he's studying to be a playwright,

60
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:49,271
so he's doing tech for us,
unpaid, for nine months.

61
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,066
Yeah. He's Ravi Nandan, OK?

62
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,111
He's one of these new Indian types.

63
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,488
He's a real "Aziz, I'm sorry."

64
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,823
[audience laugh]

65
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:04,369
But we like to joke that Ravi
is the master of <i>fun.</i>

66
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,334
One of our famous turns.

67
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,712
Back to us.

68
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,505
Some of our accolades:

69
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:20,677
We are the recipients
of a 1997 restraining order.

70
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:26,016
Keeping us 100 feet at all times
from America's greatest actor,

71
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,768
Mr. Alan Alda.

72
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:33,106
Alan Alda, double A, beep, beep!
"Get off my property!"

73
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,817
But who are we really? You know?

74
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,737
What is our essence? How to describe?

75
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,199
You know when you get to the bottom
of a tub of hummus.

76
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,243
And you can't fit your carrot in there,

77
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,704
so you gotta use your fingies
to scoop it out?

78
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,166
Bam! That's us, baby!

79
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,918
[applause]

80
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,339
How can I describe
the kind of vibe we give off?

81
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,383
You know when you walk by a travel agency

82
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,135
and you're like, "What?"

83
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,722
- There you go.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,060
We are the <i>Yerba Mate </i>tea bags,

85
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,188
steaming the counter top
of American pop culture.

86
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,816
But who are we as individuals?

87
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,901
Do you mind if I get into my big story?

88
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,653
See the stage, use it.

89
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,780
And I accept the stage from you, sir.

90
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,200
Of course, you all know me,
I'm George St. Geegland.

91
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,368
- [crowd hooting]
- Hush.

92
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,372
I'm the type of man
you would catch at a party

93
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,249
going through the coats.

94
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,877
I am neither Jewish, nor a woman,

95
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,713
but like many men over the age of 70,

96
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,384
I have reached that point in life
where I am somehow both.

97
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,804
I was born in Providence, Rhode Island,

98
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:50,267
and I am responsible for reintroducing
the Polio virus to my school district.

99
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:55,146
As a novelist,
I was once compared to Philip Roth.

100
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,024
I was also once compared
to a police sketch

101
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,360
of this Central Park flasher.

102
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,323
And guess what, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been married three times.

103
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,200
Unlucky in love, we like to joke.

104
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,828
Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!

105
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:16,209
All three of my wives died in the same way
on the same staircase.

106
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:23,883
Each death learning from
and improving upon the death before it.

107
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,596
And a fun fact
for this evening's performance,

108
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,515
I am on competing medications.

109
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,312
[applause]

110
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,860
Well, charmed I'm sure, I'm Gil Faizon.

111
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:46,323
I am a Tony Award viewing actor.

112
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,117
And whether I live
in your building or not,

113
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,245
I am somehow on your co-op board.

114
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,500
I look like if Steven Spielberg
hadn't made any money.

115
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,127
[audience laugh]

116
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,089
Over the years,
I've had a real back and forth

117
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,135
a <i>tête-à-têtes </i>of sorts
with fellow actor, Richard Dreyfuss.

118
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,846
He of course got the lead in <i>Jaws,</i>

119
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,308
and I have lockjaw
from all the cocaine I've done.

120
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,271
I'm also an unlicensed doula.

121
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,611
But I've made the most of my living
as a voice-over artist.

122
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,531
I was very nearly
the official voice of CBS.

123
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,534
Yes he was... I'm sorry,
I did not mean to interrupt you,

124
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,496
but you did such
a beautiful audition for CBS.

125
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,915
Would you do for them tonight
your CBS audition?

126
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,167
I don't know if the audience
wants to hear it.

127
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,919
[applause]

128
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,340
I was gonna do it regardless, you know.

129
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,677
This was my audition for CBS.

130
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,637
[clears throat]

131
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:57,143
Charmed, I'm sure, this is Gil Faizon
represented by Don Buchwald & Associates.

132
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,605
Reading for the role of CBS.

133
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:05,568
This is CBS, baby!

134
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,445
Fun and flirty,

135
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,949
but am I nuts, did you do
like a second alternate take?

136
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,575
- Yeah.
- Right, you did.

137
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,079
As an actor, you got to give options, OK?

138
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,041
This is one of the main things
that I teach in my acting seminar,

139
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,586
which is called,
"Improvisation for Non-Listeners."

140
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,508
It's a five-hour seminar,
and you get a chicken lunch.

141
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,135
It's a buffalo chicken wrap.

142
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,513
- It's so cold...
- It's 90 percent romaine lettuce.

143
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,017
It's a cold wrap, a warm Sierra Mist,

144
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,104
- it's on a Saturday, it's 900 dollars.
- Yeah...

145
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,649
It really is, it really is, OK.

146
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,611
This is take two,
Gil Faizon, charmed, I'm sure,

147
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,032
formerly represented
by Don Buchwald and Associates,

148
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,616
reading for the role of CBS.

149
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,370
CBS?

150
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,788
[high pitched] All right!

151
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,081
Perfect!

152
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,500
Perfect! And let me say something,

153
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:07,255
I am like, Raven-Symoné level upset
that you did not get that job.

154
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,884
George, That is so Raven of you to say.

155
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,303
It's not ravin', it's true.

156
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,056
You, Gil Faizon,
how many times have I told you?

157
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,183
You are the strongest actor in New York?

158
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,350
Ah, this guy...

159
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,977
This guy is my rock.

160
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:25,648
He was the one who broke the news to me
that I wasn't gonna get the CBS job.

161
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,127
- Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
- [high pitched] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,194
And you know what?

163
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,655
He wouldn't let me sulk
for one single second, nay, nay, nay.

164
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,075
He made me go right back on the horse.

165
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,702
We started doing heroin that afternoon.

166
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:42,832
And we'd shoot it between our toes
to keep our arms clear for racquetball.

167
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah.

168
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,627
And then what did he do?

169
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,172
He gave me the greatest gift
that a writer can give an actor.

170
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,883
He wrote a play for <i>me </i>to star in.

171
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,760
Which brings us to tonight.

172
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,180
You see, over the years, I've written
several plays for Gil and I to perform...

173
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,849
- George, you remember the first?
- The first play we ever did?

174
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,392
- Yes.
- Yes. I'll never forget it.

175
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,270
The first play we ever did?
I'll never forget.

176
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,317
I was inspired by
and directly stolen from...

177
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,737
Sam Shepard's classic, <i>True West.</i>

178
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,032
Yeah, but ours was called,
<i>True Upper West.</i>

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,162
That was the big
M. Night Shyamalan twist at the end.

180
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,916
Is at the end, you'd widen out,
which is hard to do in a play.

181
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,669
But you'd widen out.

182
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,464
And the whole time
it had been the Upper West side,

183
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,967
and there's like, a Judaica store,

184
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,011
that's always closed.

185
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,681
Who's that?

186
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,641
Who's that? Who's that guy?

187
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,560
That's a sewer pop-up guy.

188
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,855
You know, a guy pops out of his sewer,
"No, thanks," back down.

189
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:52,652
Now, famously in the revival of <i>True West,</i>
you'd see Reilly and...

190
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,198
- I'm sorry. And "Phil Sey" Hoffman.
- [groans]

191
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,741
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:04,205
It's hard, because we get choked up on cue
at the same point, every show.

193
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:09,085
We just really wanted to make
Philip Seymour Hoffman's death about us.

194
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,170
You know?

195
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:15,425
Ladies and gentlemen, it behooves you
when a famous person dies,

196
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,803
blame the year and make it about you.

197
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,140
- [George] Yeah, yeah.
- [audience clapping]

198
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:30,940
To take a Getty Image,
a watermarked Getty Image,

199
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:35,361
and post a picture
on your shitty Facebook.com page.

200
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,407
It means the world to these dead people.

201
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,120
Now, famously,
in that revival of <i>True West,</i>

202
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,123
John C. Reilly and "Phil Sey" Hoffman

203
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,459
would switch parts every night.

204
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,297
We would do <i>our </i>version of that.

205
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,925
We would switch medications, OK?

206
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,094
I would take George's anti-psychotics.

207
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,805
And I would apply Gil's eczema cream.

208
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,768
But many of you millennials
probably know us

209
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,730
from our hit existential drama,
<i>Waiting for Godot...</i>

210
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,898
Hello.

211
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,861
But in our version,
Godot shows up, like three minutes in,

212
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,157
and then we prank that mofo
with <i>Too Much Tuna, </i>baby.

213
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,243
We come out with bowler hats on.

214
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,648
We take them off, [clicks tongue]

215
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,331
we got two tuna sandwiches on our heads.

216
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,750
And the audience was in stitches.

217
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,505
Literally, because we were performing
at a burn ward in Washington Heights.

218
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,882
And these...

219
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,718
- Say it.
- These fucking Dominicans...

220
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,390
It was like...
Hey, shut the door. It was like...

221
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,809
Like they didn't understand it.

222
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,437
And those that understood English,
it was like, they didn't like it.

223
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,316
Most of our plays
had been mounted in hospitals,

224
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,904
or kill shelters
or as a skit during break at AA.

225
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:04,701
Which is why it is such an honor
to be here tonight.

226
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,453
At the Winter Garden Theater!

227
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,124
No, no, the Lyceum Theater!

228
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,625
[applause]

229
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,755
I thought we booked
the Winter Garden Theater.

230
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,384
Have you fucking tried dealing
with the Shubert Organization?

231
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,095
I mean, this is a historic theater.

232
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,932
Liza Minnelli mounted her iconic
<i>Liza with a "Z" </i>on this very stage,

233
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,268
directed by the great Bob Fosse.

234
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,145
And if you listen very closely,

235
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,440
you can hear in the rafters
the ghost of Bob Fosse,

236
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,276
snorting Dexedrine and drinking Visine.

237
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:44,532
Here in this theater, haunted by ghosts
who could not book a different theater.

238
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,912
Here in this theater
which is basically on Sixth Avenue.

239
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,833
So many great playwrights
have staged their works.

240
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,753
Tennessee Williams and his sister Serena.

241
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,215
You know, they were rivals
but they loved each other.

242
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,678
- I blame the father.
- [both] He pushed them too hard.

243
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,556
- I like your take.
- I like your style.

244
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,559
That's why this is the perfect venue

245
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,436
for us to present to you...

246
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,438
our new play!

247
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,899
Ravi, curtain!

248
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,862
[cheering]

249
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:33,456
Can you imagine a Broadway show
exceeding your expectations

250
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,833
by having a set?

251
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:42,173
All of this stuff cobbled together
from discarded Broadway sets

252
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:46,803
from some weird warehouse
in Secaucus, New Jersey.

253
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,055
They have everything at this place.

254
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,307
Old props, old costumes,

255
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,353
the cast of <i>Newsies</i>
huddled over a flaming garbage can.

256
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:01,776
This right here, this is the actual set
from the 2005 revival of <i>Steel Magnolias</i>

257
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,153
mounted right here at the Lyceum Theater.

258
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,407
<i>Steel Magnolias, </i>first a play,
then a movie, then again, a play.

259
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,326
The Broadway equivalent
of moving back in with your parents.

260
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,832
What about this wall and staircase
from a classic work of August Wilson's.

261
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,502
August Wilson, the acclaimed
African-American playwright.

262
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,046
I could name so many titles of his plays,

263
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,048
but I'm gonna walk over here now.

264
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,219
And what's this right here?
A trapdoor, yes.

265
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,515
This is the trapdoor from the set
of <i>The Diary of Anne Frank. </i>Yeah!

266
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,435
Not to be confused
with the diary of Anne Hathaway

267
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,479
which we stole out of her purse
at the Gotham Awards.

268
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,149
And what's inside? Oh, no, what's this?

269
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,733
Oh, me, oh, my!

270
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:47,780
It's the pillowman
from Martin McDonagh's <i>The Pillowman.</i>

271
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,242
And for those you at the crappy sightline
who can't see this, raise your hand.

272
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,744
Raise your hands if you can't see this.
All right. OK.

273
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,497
So what you're missing is...

274
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:02,170
It's a pillow with googly eyes
and paper towel arms, all right?

275
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,674
So next time, get your tickets earlier
or just make more money.

276
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:16,684
And in honor of Jean-Paul Sartre's
classic play, <i>No Exit,</i>

277
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,688
we have installed a "No Exit" sign.

278
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:27,403
Which the city of New York informs
us is a massive fire hazard.

279
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,864
And what's this right here, the gramophone

280
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,575
and shelving unit
from a Tony Award winning play,

281
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,412
again mounted right here
at the Lyceum Theater, <i>I Am My Own Wife.</i>

282
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,624
You know, I once had Gil
pretend to be my own wife,

283
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,294
in order to throw off
the homicide detective's timeline.

284
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,048
I wore a dress.

285
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,345
Why he wore a dress to make a phone call,
we will never know.

286
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,974
And what's this right here?
This is the heart and soul of this set.

287
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,311
This is the original stoop
from <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

288
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,231
Which we got for like, nothing.

289
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,400
They paid us to take it.

290
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:10,530
They were like, "This thing's got
bad juju, get it off our hands", you know.

291
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,575
But of course, the final piece
of inanimate set decoration,

292
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,494
is you, the audience.

293
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,456
A collection of comedy nerds
and theater dorks and...

294
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,962
[laughs] children whose parents
have made a severe miscalculation.

295
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,967
All of you gathered together,

296
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,178
wondering if there will be
an intermission.

297
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,806
There will not!

298
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,309
While you're here in the theater,
some ground rules to follow.

299
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,312
Ground rules, first off,
cellphones, turn them on!

300
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,772
Take calls.

301
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,276
Take calls, text people.

302
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,946
But if you're gonna text someone,
do it like your dad in temple, you know?

303
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,872
Also, we have free Wi-Fi
for everyone here tonight.

304
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,460
The network is "Kimpton Hotels,"
and the password is "guest."

305
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,381
If you have winter hats and coats,

306
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,718
put your <i>shit </i>wherever you want.

307
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:19,390
Treat this theater the way
an Ultra-Orthodox Jew treats an airplane.

308
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,350
Spread out!

309
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,479
That chair is for your hat, baby.

310
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,859
Perhaps you didn't have time
before the show

311
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,279
to eat at Guy Fieri's
Great American Garbage Fire.

312
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,784
- Eat food in the theater.
- Eat a meal during the play.

313
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,203
Even if you're like a Jamaican nurse,

314
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,749
and you brought your dinner
in a big weird Tupperware.

315
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,168
And when you crack the lid,

316
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,836
wow!

317
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,633
It changes the pH of the room.

318
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,805
Maybe you brought yourself a sweet treat
'cause you got low blood sugar.

319
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,933
Make sure to open
your little plastic candies...

320
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,603
- [crinkles paper]
<i>- Very </i>slowly.

321
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,024
Thinking they'll make less noise,
whereas this will make so much more noise.

322
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:15,154
Really, indulge the crinkle
as you undress your Swedish Fish,

323
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,574
the Lamborghini of the gummies.

324
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,204
Or perhaps you brought yourself
a Werther's Original,

325
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,873
the AMBER Alert of caramels.

326
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,458
[audience laugh]

327
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,297
Now, those of you familiar with
our <i>oeuvre, </i>which means eggs,

328
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,133
will recognize this play.

329
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,470
It's a little more autobiographical
than our other plays.

330
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,514
- That's right. <i>Oh, Hello.</i>
<i>- Oh, Hello.</i>

331
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,810
We draw on 70 years of a life lived.

332
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,771
A first job, a second marriage.

333
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,357
When you open your cab door
into a city biker

334
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,485
as a silent protest
against Mayor De Blasio.

335
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,572
It's a play about
those emotional moments in life,

336
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,867
like when you get a multi-vitamin
caught in your throat

337
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:06,288
and it burns so bad that you bail
on your daughter's wedding.

338
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,251
I play a character
named George Reddington.

339
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,420
Yes, he's a bit based on me.

340
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,714
He's a very successful novelist,

341
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,883
who's having a lot of trouble
with this Swedish Fish right now.

342
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,220
And I play Gil Stone,

343
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,932
a working actor
who just got yelled at backstage

344
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,727
for moving a chair in a Union House.

345
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,312
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,857
Oh, yeah? Well you know what?

347
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,651
In England, that's a slang term
for cigarettes, so...

348
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,866
We love the great traditions
of the theater

349
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,786
and that is why we plan
to pay humpage to them tonight.

350
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,622
For example, the one-sided telephone call.

351
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,625
Oh, this is very good.
The one-sided telephone call.

352
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,962
This is when a character in a play,
does a telephone call,

353
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,674
but they repeat all
the phone call information out loud

354
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,509
to the other characters on the stage.

355
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,472
First, get a telephone
no one would have in real life.

356
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,890
Oh, hello.

357
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:12,021
Then as an actor, do way too much business
with the phone, all right?

358
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:16,150
Really make a fucking meal out of it.

359
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,156
And now, we humbly present
the one-sided telephone call.

360
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,575
Ravi, a melodramatic wash.

361
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,330
Oh, hello?

362
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,540
Oh, charmed, I'm sure.

363
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,834
The police?

364
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,419
That's who <i>you </i>are?

365
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,924
A car accident?

366
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,387
George's daughter?

367
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,266
Her head ended up where?

368
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,663
- Are they talking...
- I'm on the phone, I'm on the phone, man.

369
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,689
OK, yeah,

370
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,274
I'll tell him.

371
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,027
Oh, charmed, I'm sure.

372
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,991
Hey, George, my friend of all friends.

373
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,660
Look at me!

374
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,412
I have awful, simply horrible news,

375
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,874
but that was a one-sided telephone call!

376
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,376
[airhorn sounds]

377
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:21,090
[applause]

378
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,467
You are so stupid.

379
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,264
My daughter is not dead,
I talked to her a year ago.

380
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,769
Another device I love in theater
is coughing into a handkerchief

381
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,896
to show the audience that you are dying.

382
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,983
- Would you assist me with this?
- All right.

383
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,193
[groans]

384
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,824
Hey, little kids, get your ice cream.
Get your...

385
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,578
Are you sick, Mr. Manzini?

386
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,122
No, Giuseppe.

387
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,416
I'ma gonna be OK.

388
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,251
Boom time!

389
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,296
He's not well.

390
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,674
That guy is sick as a dick.

391
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,720
- Audiences like to be screamed at.
- Correct.

392
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:13,601
The backbone of contemporary
American theater is screaming stuff.

393
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,230
For starters, it wakes the audience up
towards the end of the third act.

394
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,151
But also it reveals things from the past.

395
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:26,989
My father was my brother
and that's why we can't go to lunch today.

396
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,909
Do you want to know why?

397
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,622
Do you want to know why, Karen?

398
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,500
Because I could not afford
Adobe Photoshop!

399
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,630
My baby.

400
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,341
My chair baby.

401
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,468
He killed you.

402
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,929
Why?

403
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,395
[applause]

404
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,942
That is of course, from lonesco's <i>Chairs.</i>

405
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,278
Let's talk endings.

406
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:10,616
I like when a character
says something mildly significant,

407
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,201
and then the lights dim,

408
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,411
and you're sitting in your seat,
you're like...

409
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,164
Huh?

410
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,166
Is that... is that...

411
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,752
"Is that the fucking end of the play?"

412
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,341
May I demonstrate
one of these awful dim lights?

413
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,176
- Porcupine please.
- Thank you.

414
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,304
Is there a center mark for me to stand?

415
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,223
OK, that'll do.

416
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,060
Ravi, can you write a "G" on that
so I know it's for George and not Gil?

417
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,395
Thank you.

418
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,564
Ravi, hit me with the spotlight.

419
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,403
By the way, Ravi, way too loud
with the intro music. Way too loud.

420
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,197
You bring the house to half,
then you do the announce.

421
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,658
Don't ever pooch the opening
in my show again.

422
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,661
All right, we're having a nice time, so...

423
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:00,582
So this is a line of dialogue
and then it dimmed.

424
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:05,963
You know, looking back,
my father was a poor man,

425
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:10,092
but in the end,
he gave us the greatest gift of all,

426
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,763
a 1997 Toyota Tercel.

427
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,102
[laughter and applause]

428
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,397
Thank you.

429
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,691
- What are you eating?
- Cashews.

430
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,401
Oh!

431
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,112
- That's expensive.
- But imaginary.

432
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,822
- There you go.
- All right, yeah.

433
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,991
I'm allergic.

434
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,662
- Uh, I take grievance.
- With my performance?

435
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,582
No, the performance
was Pontiac perfection. Yeah

436
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,960
- I take grievance with the dialogue.
- Too poignant?

437
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,170
- Too significant.
- Yes.

438
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,464
I like when a play ends just a sentence.

439
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,884
That naturalistic thing,
where the playwright is trying to say,

440
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,052
there's no good dialogue in real life,

441
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,472
- so why should I work that hard?
- Yeah.

442
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,517
- Mother, may I?
- Speak in plain, child.

443
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,103
[mumbles to self]

444
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,942
Oh, waiter,

445
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,488
I'll have one more root beer, please.

446
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,032
Man...

447
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,284
[laughter and applause]

448
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,753
I got the chills.

449
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,713
I got the chills.

450
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,173
[yelping in delight]

451
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,467
- I got the chills.
- You got the chills, man?

452
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,677
- Are you...
- [yelps] I got them.

453
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,806
You got the chills, are you sick?

454
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:42,226
No, I got the chills
from your magnificent performance.

455
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,187
- Though I do have pneumococcal pneumonia.
- All right.

456
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,773
You know, I have mesothelioma.

457
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,857
How did you get it?

458
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,150
From a commercial.

459
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,197
Well, we are about to get started.

460
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,698
But before we do...

461
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,161
- You gonna hold that?
- Yeah.

462
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,579
- All right.
- It's got a flick...

463
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,122
- I'm just gonna flick the tip.
- OK.

464
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,168
That made it a billion times
worse right there.

465
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,004
We are about to get started.

466
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,590
- No, fucking... No.
- What?

467
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,718
Not in life or in the play ever,

468
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,264
ever put your nail in between my nail.

469
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,391
In my fingie meat.

470
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,602
For real, don't ever do that ever again,
for real.

471
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,772
- This... That's a protected settlement.
- Yeah.

472
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,192
[indistinct]

473
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,404
Then I'm Netanyahu, baby!

474
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,117
- 'Cause you're my little Bibi.
- Yeah, that's right.

475
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,078
Why are you holding on to my finger?

476
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,581
'Cause I'm nervous.
I want the show to go well.

477
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,708
Because we're on Broadway.

478
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,460
But, Gil, remember what we always say?

479
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,213
Treat a four like a six,
and she'll be grateful.

480
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,345
No. Let's do our best.

481
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,931
- Oh!
- Jesus Christ!

482
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,310
Enjoy the play!

483
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,520
[cheering]

484
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,444
- This crowd sucks.
- Yeah, it's great.

485
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,783
[dramatic music]

486
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,579
George steps forward
to read stage direction.

487
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:32,377
He leans to one side because
the "stage direction" is italicized.

488
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:40,010
Our play begins
on the Upper West Side of Manhattan,

489
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,472
73rd & Columbus, to be exact.

490
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:48,227
The setting: A large Upper West Side
rent-controlled building.

491
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,938
The kind of place
where all the recycling bins

492
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,523
are filled with used oxygen tanks.

493
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,651
And what's this up here?

494
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:57,694
What?

495
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,907
Why, it's the front door
of our two heroes' apartment.

496
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,285
A mezuzah is nailed to the door frame.

497
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,998
Just below the painted over nails
of a former mezuzah.

498
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,586
And for those of you
observant enough to clock,

499
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,799
that this mezuzah is on the wrong side
of the door frame,

500
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,342
you're at the right play.

501
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,761
[audience laugh]

502
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,849
We open on a brown room,
with pea-colored sunlight

503
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:32,562
illuminating what must be pounds
of flaked off, old man dry skin.

504
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,190
We meet George Reddington.

505
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:39,486
George can hardly get hard,
so he must use a tongue depressor

506
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,613
as a splint on his schvantz.

507
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,287
I don't know.

508
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,208
George is hung like a hotel painting,

509
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,629
in that it's crooked
and has seen awful things.

510
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:58,797
[audience laugh]

511
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,721
He speaks on the phone. Shh!

512
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,685
Well, I'm doing pretty well,
considering I'm a 72-year-old novelist,

513
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,230
and I live with my best friend Gil
and he's an actor. OK, bye.

514
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:24,698
Just then, Gil Stone, aged 40, enters.

515
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,785
- Are you sure you can play 40?
- [high pitched] Yes!

516
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,039
Gil Stone, aged 40, enters.

517
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,166
He is soaked from the rain.

518
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,423
No matter what
health food store you go to,

519
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,092
Gil is blocking the vitamin aisle.

520
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:49,598
Gil's hair,
it's like the JonBenét Ramsey case.

521
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:54,019
The more you look into it,
the more questions you have.

522
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,857
Gil speaks and says his lines as written.

523
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,736
George, have you ever noticed
that New York in the rain

524
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,404
is like jazz music?

525
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,909
No, I haven't, my friend,
but keep going with this.

526
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:13,372
Well, they're in drops.
There like a brush on a tight snare drum.

527
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,664
[snares play]

528
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,084
And the honking of the horns. Oh!

529
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,669
That's like Miles, baby.

530
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,839
[jazz music plays]

531
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,052
And for the subway?
You got yourself a xylophone.

532
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,678
Bing bong.

533
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,515
"Stay clear of the falling rain, please."

534
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,892
I don't want to do the water anymore.

535
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,852
Whoa! Whoa!

536
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,022
The water spray is the fucking
strongest part of the show.

537
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,567
Makes my glasses all watery.

538
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,736
Look, I know that, OK?

539
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,656
You know, Mark and Judy came
with their adult son last week,

540
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,574
they told me they love the water spray.

541
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,077
But Mark and Judy like Stomp.

542
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,666
- You know, I like Stomp.
- I love Stomp.

543
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,793
They bang everything.

544
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,046
It's the new... You have got
to go see Stomp on tour.

545
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,006
- It's the same.
- Ah!

546
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,845
So tell me, Gil, how was your meeting
today with your agent?

547
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,972
- It was horrible.
- Oh, no.

548
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,016
I mean, he doesn't get me at all.
You know?

549
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,769
I'm a serious theater actor.

550
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,313
He's got me going out for commercials.

551
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,107
Can you imagine me,

552
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,527
Gil Stone, hocking Scotch Tape?

553
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,158
There you go again
with that artistic integrity.

554
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,326
See me? I'm all about money.

555
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,580
What are we, two characters
with different perspectives?

556
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:41,835
[splattered laughter]

557
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,463
- I can't do it anymore, George.
- Gil.

558
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,549
- I got to get out of this rat race.
- Be pragmatic.

559
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,136
I walked out of an audition today.

560
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,263
For Clamato, I mean...

561
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,266
We're talking about Clamato, George.

562
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:02,063
The number one clam/tomato
juice operation in the country today.

563
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,566
Some would say the only.

564
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,111
How could you walk out of that?
What is going on with you?

565
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:11,406
I made a promise, George. A promise.

566
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,492
To my parents.

567
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,746
I miss them, you know.

568
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,792
You know, my father, before he died,
he told me two things.

569
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,796
First, that he ratted out other Jews
during the Holocaust.

570
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,677
And second, and more importantly...

571
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,515
He said, you got to be yourself.

572
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,769
And that's what I'm trying to do every day
in this crazy rat race, man.

573
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,771
Is, I got to be me.

574
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,481
I got to be Gil!

575
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,942
This line hangs there in the air

576
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,986
like Lenny Kravitz's very nice,
very full penis,

577
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,322
remember when his pants split
and it fell out.

578
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:56,368
There's a video of it.
This was like, 15 months ago.

579
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,036
We here it at <i>Oh, Hello </i>feel

580
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,956
this did not get enough attention
at the time.

581
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,332
[audience laugh]

582
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,793
Gil continues speaking.

583
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,713
But then suddenly and quite inorganically,
he starts singing.

584
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,550
So I walk out of the audition,

585
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,844
and I head over to Fairway Supermarket
to molest olives.

586
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,765
And that's when it hits me.

587
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:24,771
<i>♪ Sweet Rosalie
She's working at the five and dime ♪</i>

588
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,732
I have had that song
stuck in my head all day, Gil.

589
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:33,822
<i>♪ Train back to Hackensack

590
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:38,326

<i>♪ Cocaine, snort ♪</i>

593
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,709
<i>♪ We both like to do cocaine ♪</i>

594
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,713
- God, what is that song?
- It's got to be Steely Dan, right?

595
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:53,592
Oh, it's a billion percent Steely Dan.

596
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:57,470
Remember seeing Steely Dan at
the Beacon Theater, nine nights in a row?

597
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,389
I love the Beacon Theater.

598
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,350
Oh, the Beacon Theater,
it's like the Apollo Theater

599
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,520
for people who are scared to go
into the Apollo.

600
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,940
Walter Becker from Steely Dan,

601
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:13,486
playing his guitar like he's in the band
at the end of a Lunesta commercial.

602
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,449
Donald Fagen on the keys

603
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:21,328
looking like if Ray Charles
played the organ at a reformed synagogue.

604
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,624
[beatboxing the bass guitar]

605
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,669
George, did you know the name Steely Dan

606
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,922
originated as a dildo
in a William Burroughs novel?

607
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,424
Of course, I know that.

608
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,010
You and I know a lot about Steely Dan.

609
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,598
- Gil?
- Here.

610
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,892
- Would you check the mail for me?
- All right.

611
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,519
I'm waiting on a reply from my publisher

612
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:50,357
about my new novel, <i>Next Stop: Ronkonkoma.</i>

613
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,777
It's the story of a Long Island
railroad trip

614
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,155
told from a hundred
different perspectives.

615
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,537
Let's see here. [clears throat]

616
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,206
"Attention, tenants.

Water will be shut off
from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m.

00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,795
to punish the unemployed."

619
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,674
Seems mean-spirited, right?

620
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,467
I make my own water.

621
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,680

is no longer rent-controlled."

But we've been living
in this apartment for 40 years,

625
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,486
paying $75 a month.

626
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,698
It's our God-given right
to pay the same amount of rent

627
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,409
regardless of property value or inflation.

628
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,536
This is an outrage.

629
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,996
Ravi, I need that chair to shatter.

630
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,748
Let me see this.

"Your rent is being increased
to $2,500 a month."

632
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,131
Twenty-five hundred dollars
for a measly five-bedroom

633
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,675
with office, crown molding, and fireplace?

634
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,219
How much money do I even have on me?

635
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,431
What is this?
"Remember, you have Alzheimer's."

636
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,599
What does that even mean?

637
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:12,272
I'm so sick of finding
all these stupid notes in all my shit.

638
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,776
When I find the guy
that's putting them there...

639
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,987
What are you gonna do to him, Georgie?

640
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,947
You know, c'mere jabroni.

[Gil] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Tell me, Gil, is there a third...

644
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,334
Tell me, Gil,
is there a third letter from my...

645
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,962
- It works best if I do the set up.
- OK.

646
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,801
Gil, is there a... Fucking wait!

647
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,429
[loud laughter]

648
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,694
Say, Gil, is there a third letter
from my publisher?

649
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,030
Maybe if they sent a big enough advance,

650
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,532
we don't have to worry about the new rent.

651
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,164
- Give me the fucking letter.
- Just ask for the letter.

652
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,501
- Are we on the same team?
- Yeah.

653
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,252
The '86 Mets.

654
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,508
- You're all right, you know that?
- Yeah, thanks, man.

655
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,220
- It's from them and it's nice and thin.
- Less is more, Georgie.

656
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,097
Good news comes in thin envelopes.

657
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,558
"Dear Mr. Reddington.

A one thousand page,
totally unproofed document.

Unfortunately, we are only interested
in young adult puff pieces now.

Like <i>Twilight </i>or <i>The Corrections.</i>

662

Maybe you should give more thought
to a younger audience."

But, George, what did the letter say?

666
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,012
It said I'm not gonna get the book deal.

667
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,973
Oh, my God,
I'm not gonna get the book deal.

668
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,352
And I already bought that sheep dog
for the author photo.

00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,747
What happens if you don't get the advance?

674
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,041
Without that advance,
we don't have any money,

675
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,793
and we're gonna lose our apartment.

676
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:43,298
But we've been living in this apartment

854
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:18,432
<i>- Too Much Tuna </i>is a talk show
- Yeah!

855
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,309
- With no prank element.
- No, no.

856
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:24,021
We merely interview the greatest

857
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,733

huge fucking tuna comeuppance.

we have a very special guest.

I have great hopes from here on out.

00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,727
Oh, that's so nice.

894
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,772
You yourself are a playwright
of some great esteem.

895
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,231
Well, thank you very much.

896
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,859
- But I think you've nailed it.
- Thank you.

897
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:37,237
- You nailed the essence of playwriting.
- Thank you.

898
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,448
By the way, you know
what Mike Nichols told me once.

899
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,201
- He said, there was the...
- Oh, you drop something.

900
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,332
Jesus Christ.
Two minutes in to the interview.

901
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,336
- Not that Mike Nichols.
- Oh, all right.

902
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:58,300
He told me that RKO Pictures
had a philosophy that if...

903
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:02,179
In their movies, when the phone rang,
if the news was sad,

904
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,764
you answer the phone happy.

905
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,558
And if the news was happy,
you answer the phone sad.

906
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:08,102
I don't understand.

907
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,939
- Can I see an example of this?
- Yes. Where's the phone?

908
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,650
Let's get Steve a phone, OK.

909
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,610
Here we go.

910
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,655
Do you want to do a cross?
Or do you want to be seated?

911
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,739
How do you wanna do this?

912
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,908
I think I have to cross.
We have to be talking.

913
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,493
Is the news happy or sad?

914
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,662
- It's gonna be sad.
- It's gonna be sad.

915
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,455
Oh, that's so...

916
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,500
I know, it was so great.
That was so funny...

917
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,793
Sorry.

918
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:36,964
OK!

919
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,135
Action one. Action one.

920
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,722
- I think to be fair, I should...
- Yes, OK.

921
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,976
I'm much worse in quiet banter
than he is, but I'll do my best.

922
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,602
I will do my best, OK.

923
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,729

She is?

927
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,037
Did I tell you who told me that story?

928
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,539
- Who was that?
- Mike Nichols.

Mike Nichols his podiatrist
on 83rd Street.

931
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,505
- Let's keep it.
- You want to keep it?

932
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,925
- First of all, I'm taking it.
- You're taking it? You're welcome to it.

933
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,803
Everyone, by the way,
take anything you want.

Anything you guys want.

935
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,307
Do you have any memorabilia from films,

936
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,034
things you've taken
that are special to you?

937
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,352
- Yes.
- Would you name them now?

938
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,479
Oh!

939
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,982
I have my <i>Three Amigos </i>outfit.

940
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,696
- Do you ever put it on?
- Do I ever put it on?

941
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,657
- You ever wear it?
- I don't want to go there now.

942
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,203
- You could be deported very quickly.
- [Gil]Yeah!

00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,372
[applause]

944
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,419

- Oh, he is?

00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,087
Yeah, it's called <i>No Amigos.</i>

946
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,299
[Steve] Yeah.

947
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,844
Did you ever know Trump
in your dealings...

948
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,764
- I never met him, no.
- Never?

949
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,475
He wasn't at <i>New Yorker </i>cocktail parties?

950
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,269
- No.
- No?

951
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,731
- That would be very unlikely, wouldn't it?
- Yes, it would.

952
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,859
And you never went
to Maxim Hottest 100 parties.

953
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:25,155
- But you are an art collector.
- Yes, that's...

954
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:29,159
Well, I have collected a few paintings
uh, through my life.

955
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:34,206
I'm happy to say that I've actually earned
more money doing that than show business.

956
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,375
- Really?
- No, I'm kidding.

957
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,794
Hello, who's that guy?

958
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,589
Did Jews not control the world of art?

959
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,593
- Do people think you're Jewish or no?
- No, they don't.

960
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,095
Oh, congratulations.

961
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:53,225
I can honestly say that not one person.

962
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,894
You've never been stopped
on the street? "You Jewish?"

963
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,896
- "You Jewish?"
- No.

964
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,609
Presbyterians don't do that?
"You Presbyterian?

965
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,945
We need 10 Presbyterians

966
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,068
to make a mayonnaise sandwich,
please come with us."

967
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,704
There's always a crisis
with Jews on the street.

968
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,664
Are you a religious man?

969
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,416
- No, not at all.
- No?

970
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:22,629
- Did you ever believe in God?
- Probably when I was a young kid.

971
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,339
But no more.

972
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,550
Was magic...
Was it because you believe in magic?

973
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:34,850
Yes, learning... When I realized
card tricks were actually a trick,

974
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,102
- I said, there must be no God.
- Yes.

975
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:43,191
You started re-reading Jesus' miracles
and you're like, "I know how to do that."

976
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,737
Plexiglass under the water.

977
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,032
You just break a fish up
into a bunch of different pieces.

978
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,452
- Or palming a fish.
- Yeah, you palm a fish and...

979
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,412
Oh, look what I have here.

980
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,791
What was your first trick you learned?
Do you remember?

981
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,460
That's really private.

982
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:07,007
No, I don't. I can't remember that.

983
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:09,134
It was probably a store-bought trick.

984
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,803
Not just simple slight of hand?

985
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,555
Well, I learned that later. Yeah.

986
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,284
- Do you still know slight of hand?
- I still know a little bit of it.

987
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,310
- Could you do it with a French fry?
- Sure.

988

[applause]

989
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,119
It's OK. It's OK.

990
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:37,996
It's OK.

991
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,749
It's OK.

992
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,542
It's for you.

993
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,212
Yeah, that's right.

994
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,089
Oh, OK.

995
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,218
- You have a child now.
- I do.

996
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,596
So what is it, like money wise?
I mean, is it tighter now?

997
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,267
She's paying her own way.

998
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,769
Oh, that's great.

999
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,815
Already working. That's wonderful.
That's so cool.

1000
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,317
And what do you do for fun?

1001
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,028
I'm a comedian, actor, writer, yeah.

You know, which one
do you love the most?

1004
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:22,499
When you're doing an amphitheater,
Steve Martin, 1979.

1005
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,544
You're doing an amphitheater.
You're doing a Hollywood Bowl.

1006
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,587
What are you making for that night?

1007
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,219
Well, in those days, I was criticized
for charging a high price.

1008
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,679
- What was that?
- Ten dollars.

1009

But you're Jewish

It's a shirt you wrap around a dog
who's freaking out,

1293
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:10,821
and the dog stops freaking out,
for the most part.

How can I ever tell anyone?

1298
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:32,301
Growing up in my family,
boys didn't lease Sorentos.

1306
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,992
George, I just got a text message.

- Thrice!

We are now at the midpoint of Act One.

1315

At this point in the play,
we're gonna add a surrealist ballet.

1316
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:43,831
Now, this is in hopes of winning

1317
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:47,334
the newly-created
Tony Award for choreography

1318

during a limited run vanity project.

1319
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,466
And we now humbly present,

1320
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,886
Gil and George's
dream dance sequence,

1321
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,638
which will take you and us

1322
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:02,850
way, way, way out of our comfort zones.

1323
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,691
This dance was choreographed
by an old Asian woman

1324
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:13,277
doing tai chi in Prospect Park.

1325
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:20,785
George and Gil descend the stairs
like two walking Swastikas.

1326
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:27,124
We are now in that cemetery
that you see on the way to LaGuardia.

[making airplane noises]

1328
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,510
We see the grave of Ed Koch.

1329
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,970
The grave of Ed Koch,

1330
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:43,432
a symbol of a New York that has died.

1331
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:48,229
But from LaGuardia,
we see the beautiful New York skyline,

1332
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,941
with the paternal light phallus
of the Empire State Building.

1333
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:57,613
Work it. And the maternal light nipples
of the San Remo apartment towers.

1334
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,991
Oh, my God, look at the audience
getting all turned on.

1335
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:03,994

of <i>Chicago.</i>

under a mountain of dry ice.

1337
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,168
You know, this is not a sex show.

1338
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:14,797
- This is primal art.
- This is prehistoric.

01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:25,141
Mother, Father.

1342
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,976
And baby?

1343
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:32,189
We see a tuna baby,
we must go to it.

1344
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,110
We go to care for our tuna baby, but...

1345
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,529
[tuna laughs]

1346
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:40,281
The baby is demonic.

1347
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,533
The baby is possessed by the devil

1348
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:45,452
like when Mia Farrow
had that evil child.

1349
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,580
- Soon-Yi?
- Correct.

1350
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:51,834
After a solid Soon-Yi burn, we run.

1351
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:56,172
- Gil, where are you?
- Where is my friend George?

1352
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:59,675
Gil, save yourself. Fly away.

1353
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:03,470
Oh, no. I don't need to fly.
I'll just run with you. It's fine.

1354
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:08,309
You remember, if you believe,
you can fly!

1355
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,311
George, I'm not really strapped in.

1356
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:13,272
It's not a good idea.
Fuck it, no. I'm not gonna do it.

1357
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:16,275
I saw too many productions
of <i>Spider-Man </i>where a guy died.

1358
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,776
I'm not doing it.

1359
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:23,073
Fine. Gil and George are now safe
from the tuna monster.

1360
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,370
[roar]

1361
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:35,753
[both] This looks expensive.

1362
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,505
[cackling]

1363
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:47,598
That's <i>Too Much Tuna...</i>

1364
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,517
trademark.

1365
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:57,650
There's so much production value.

1366
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,821
George and Gil are now legitimately dizzy
so they take a knee.

1367
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:06,033
And then a bridge pose,
and then a Martha Graham,

1368
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,993
and then we lay down.

1369
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:13,874
[applause]

1370
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,339
George...

1371
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:24,843
George and Gil now rest in real time
for, like, two minutes.

1372
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:27,930
Ravi.

1373
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:29,682
Ravi.

1374
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,558
It's George.

1375
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:33,769
I'm on the floor.

1376
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,689
My blood sugar is crashing.

1377
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:41,777
Could you go get me
a Ferrero Rocher chocolate?

1378
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:46,282
Or a Lindt Lindor truffle?

1379
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,452
My favorite flavor is blue.

1380
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:58,544
Ravi, it's Gil Faizon, charmed I'm sure.

1381
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,963
Would you go to a bodega for me

1382
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,800
and get me a box
of Kashi Good Friends Cereal?

1383
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:09,138
The highest, dustiest box
you can find.

1384
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,141
Ravi.

1385
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,852
It's George, I'm on the floor.

1386
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,230
I need you to go to Just Salad,

1387
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:22,735
at like, 1 p.m.
when they're at their busiest.

1388
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:27,781
And just get on line and be like,
"Now, let's see, how does this work?"

1389
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,663
Ravi, it's Gil Faizon.

1390
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:38,584
Will you go to Chipotle
and get me a big bowl of Ebola?

1391
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,796
Ravi!

1392
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,967
Will you go to every pizza place
in New York

1393
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:51,430
and bring me the most sun-faded
headshot of Danny Aiello?

1394
01:20:57,478 --> 01:21:00,356
Ravi, it's Gil Faizon, charmed,
I'm on the floor.

1395
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:03,442
Will you go to the Magnolia Bakery

1396
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,278
as featured in the <i>Sex and the City</i>
walking tour

1397
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,030
and just open fire?

1398
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,204
Ravi!

1399
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:20,376
Will you go to Long Island City, Queens,
'cause I won't.

1400
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,466
OK, nap time is over.

1401
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,343
Flash forward.

1402
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,512
One year later.

1403
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:36,892
George and Gil are on New York One
and living on top of the world.

1404
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:40,896
Gil can not stand up
because he has polenta body.

1405
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,357
Meaning, it all holds together

1406
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,693
but it's soft
and absorbs tomato sauce.

1407
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,948
Gil is now standing like a toddler
in a YouTube video.

1408
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,618
Flash forward, one year later.

1409
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:58,455
<i>Too Much Tuna </i>is the huge hit show
in the whole Tri State Area,

1410
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,125
and George and Gil
are living the high life.

1411
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:04,753
They can get a table at the La Famiglia
Pizza in the port authority

1412
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,213
any time they want.

1413
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,176
George can finally afford
to fly JetBlue Mint

1414
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,096
from JFK all the way to LaGuardia.

1415
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:19,268
And Gil fulfills his life-long dream
of trying biscotti,

1416
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,061
and it is not worth it.

1417
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,274
George re-enters

1418
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:30,487
in a look that can only be described
as pussy safari.

1419
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:33,157
[techno music]

1420
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:41,123
We are now on the set of the corporate
and successful <i>Too Much Tuna.</i>

1421
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:44,293
God, people treat me so differently
now that I'm famous.

1422
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:49,047
It's like suddenly, jewelry stores
do have a bathroom I can use.

1423
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,758
Hey, what's up, everything?

1424
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,511
- Hey, space grandma.
- Oh, hi.

1425
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:58,348
Oh, good you got the craft services
that I like.

1426
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,143
Watermelon that's been in the fridge
for three weeks,

1427
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,937
so that when you eat it,
it's like spicy.

1428
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,899
Hey, Gil, let's take a press photo.

1429
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,150
[camera clicks]

1430
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,986
We're gonna be on the cover
of <i>Wired </i>magazine

1431
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,155
because anyone can be.

1432
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:15,908
Things really are changing.

1433
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,452
You know that black high school
that I walk by?

1434
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:21,955
The kids used to scream,
"Hey, shiboy fruity booty" or

1435
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,500
"Look at that mop-looking motherfucker."

1436
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:28,462
Now when I walk by,
they all just cackle and scream,

1437
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:31,256
"That cream-a-wheat nigga got a TV show."

1438
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,593
All right, let's get to work, everyone.

1439
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:36,512
Now that our mascot has arrived.

1440
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:40,891
- Hey, what's up, Tony?
- Hello, Tony Tuna, how was your weekend?

1441
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:43,644
Oh, my God, he's using again.

1442
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:47,231
I didn't want to say anything
but he's not going to meetings any more.

1443
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:48,357
Jesus!

1444
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,318
It's that new girlfriend of his.
She's helping him do the cocaine.

1445
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:53,403
- 'Cause he ain't got no arms.
- Who, Tony?

1446
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,656
- No, he's a sandwich with eyeballs.
- [phone rings]

1447
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,867
- Oh, hello?
- Oh, hello?

1448
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:03,413
What? No, New York One,
please, that's unacceptable.

1449
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:06,041
What? This isn't a cellphone?

1450
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,505
Did you hear what New York One
is gonna do to our show?

1451
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:15,968
They want to turn us into clam show
called "That's A Lot-o Clamato"?

1452
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,095
Which is a terrible title.

1453
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:22,140
I would call it, "You Got Clam Juice,
You White Trash Idiot."

1454
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:25,519
George, uh,

1455
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,522
I don't know if you remember
but I said, I got to be Gil,

1456
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:32,651
I got to get out of this rat race.
I won't work for Clamato.

1457
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,152
Then neither of us will.

1458
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:37,948
Gil, we're gonna confront the president
of New York One,

1459
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,784
and tell him our integrity
is not for sale.

1460
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:43,579
Great! So let's take the subway, the 4-5?

1461
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:47,040
No, let's take the R and then walk.

1462
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:48,625
Shake!

1463
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,751
[dramatic music]

1464
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,635
The climax of the play.

1465
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:03,849
We are now in the plush, billion-dollar
headquarters of New York One.

1466
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,809
There's a glass trophy case,

1467
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:09,146
filled with Xeroxes
of other people's Emmy Awards.

1468
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,440
- George...
- Gil and...

1469
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:14,192
Gil and George,
armed with their integrity,

1470
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:18,071
- are ready to do battle with the evil...
- George, please, I just need...

1471
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:20,282
with the evil network president,

1472
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,619
who, tonight,
in a very special treat for us,

1473
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,203
and for everyone here,

1474
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:29,666
is played by Broadway legend,
Mr. Matthew Broderick!

1475
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,210
- Hold!
- Hold? Shit!

1476
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,297
Matthew, no. Don't come out.
We're on a hold.

1477
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,590
What's the hold?

1478
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,216
I got to go to the bathroom.

1479
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,595
- No, you're gonna hold it.
- I've been holding it since Steve Martin.

1480
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:44,723
Please. Please, do not do this to us, OK?

1481
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,017
You're an adult.
You can control your bowels.

1482
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,894
No, it's getting pointy.

1483
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:50,604
[audience laugh]

1484
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,026
Can we just take an intermission?

1485
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:58,195
No! No fucking intermission!

1486
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:00,197
They ruin the flow of the show.

1487
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,950
Would you stop the Super Bowl
halfway through to do a bunch of bullshit?

1488
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,956
You are not leaving
to go to the bathroom.

1489
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,717
[moans softly]

1490
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:22,219
OK, I don't...

1491
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:26,056
I don't need to go
to the bathroom anymore.

1492
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,226
Come here.
Let me talk to you a bit. Come here.

1493
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:32,270
Did you just take a shit
in your show corduroys?

1494
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:35,190
Did you just take a shit
in your show corduroys?

1495
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,775
No!

1496
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,276
Goddammit!

1497
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,320
We don't have doubles of those!

1498
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,364
Lights, Ravi.

1499
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:43,782
What?

1500
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:48,370
George Reddington
wouldn't call for the lights.

1501
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,330
I am not George Reddington anymore.

1502
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:52,999
I am George St. Geegland
and you are Gil Faizon,

1503
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,502
and this is over
because you ruined it!

1504
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:58,672
Matthew Broderick
is waiting right behind that door.

1505
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:01,091
Waiting to come out and act,
and you ruined it!

1506
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:03,051

01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:40,938
Excuse me.

1673
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:46,027
Has anyone ever told you
that you look an awful lot like Gil Stone?

1674
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,821
Yeah, I get that sometimes. [chuckles]

1675
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:53,743
- George?
- George Reddington.

1676
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:58,164
- We were...
- [both] roommates for 40 years.

1677
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:02,460
Tony Tuna is here.
He's got a mustache now.

1678
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,295
To show that time has passed.

1679
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:08,382
Wow, Gil Stone.

1680
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:12,637
Hey, you remember all those years ago
when we confronted Matthew Broderick

1681
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,306
who's still waiting
right behind that door.

1682
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:19,227
And look at you now,
you're in Hollywood and you're a big star.

1683
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:22,480
I'm a star of a small
action movie franchise

1684
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:26,275
where I play a secret agent
trying to protect his family called,

1685
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:29,112
"How dare you steal my daughter?"

1686
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:39,747
But me? You, you're the number one
novelist in America.

1687
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:45,962
I guess my young adult vampire series,
<i>Skateboard Dracula </i>is doing pretty well.

1688
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:50,341
Pretty well, 15 million copies
in one day ain't too shabby.

1689
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:53,344
Yeah, but most of those teens
only bought the book

1690
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:56,305
because in it,
I explained how to make a bomb.

1691
01:38:57,807 --> 01:38:58,808
[tuts]

1692
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:04,647
- Is that your new novel?
- This? No.

1693
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:07,024
A new play I'm working on.

1694
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:10,069
Frankly, it's about me and you.

1695
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:14,532
Well, Tony Tuna and <i>Too Much Tuna</i>
and raccoons,

1696
01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:17,201
and finding your way in the world.

1697
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:31,674
George, this is the best play
I've ever read.

1698
01:39:32,258 --> 01:39:33,426
Thank you.

1699
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:36,888
- I guess I just have one question.
- Of course.

1700
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:40,224
How does it end?

1701
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,395
Why don't we find out together?

1702
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:52,695
New York City.

1703
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:55,281
A million people.

1704
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,454
A million different stories.

1705
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:06,167
And that's not even counting...
the commuters.

1706
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:12,882
Oh, waiter, I'll have...

1707
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:20,848
Well, I'll have two more
root beers, please.

1708
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:27,396
[applause]

1709
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:36,781
[music]

1710
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:49,877

1711
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:52,672

1717
