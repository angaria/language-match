1
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,915
Oh, it's only Mr. Quint! Let him in.

2
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,913
Good evening!
- Good evening, Mr. Quint!

3
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,435
It's very late, isn't it?
- Yes.

4
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,157
You won't find many customers
for your horoscopes tonight!

5
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,398
Don't mind. I am here
because of Mr. Leutner!

6
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,677
Well, the young Mr. Martin?
- Yes.

7
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,514
Tell me, Glinka, Consul
Pallant and his men,

8
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,114
When was their last stay?

9
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,795
It's written down in the other book.

10
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,759
What are you doing there?
Shouldn't you be in the restaurant?

11
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,840
Oh, Miss Mertens! I just
wanted to know if Consul Pallant

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,071
brought his horses here earlier.

13
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,192
Good evening, Miss Mertens!
- Good evening, Mr. Quint!

14
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,596
And that is why you need
to look into our records?

15
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,792
You are very curious, Mr. Wiegler!
Just do your job in the restaurant!

16
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,476
Of course, Miss Mertens, of course.

17
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,718
I promise to amend my behaviour,
Miss Mertens! - I hope so!

18
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,758
Please, Mr. Quint!
- Thank you!

19
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,918
Good old Charly Braun, you know,

20
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,515
he was a jockey at the
Oppenheims, wasn't he?

21
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,200
Mr. Rieger, this young guy seems
not very interested in the stories;

22
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,192
old Plischke has to tell...
- I am really sorry, Mr. Rieger!

23
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,710
Mr. Quint wanted to cast a
horoscope for Mr. Leutner...

24
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,435
Waiter, where are you?
- Always someone to interrupt me!

25
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,752
Even now while Mr. Rieger wants to
do an interview for his newspaper!

26
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,114
Finally! Waiter!

27
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,600
I don't care about the stars, Mr. Quint!

28
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,269
Maybe you should, Martin!

29
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,830
And I am here to convince Mr. Leutner.

30
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,639
I don't mind, I have plenty of time.

31
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,519
So may I continue?

32
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,040
Have you had a proper meal already?

33
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,280
Two Sherries, a Vermouth
and Miss Mertens.

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,393
Of course, my friend!
- What a charming, boldfaced rascal.

35
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,990
I cannot take it!
- It's okay.

36
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,237
How can I help you?
- Two sandwiches for Mr. Quint

37
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,436
and some red wine, please.

38
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,069
On the hotel bill, as usual.
Of course, Miss Mertens.

39
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,879
Just go!

40
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,189
Mr. Hammerforth would
like to talk to you.

41
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,755
Thank you very much!
- Come on, take a seat!

42
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,640
Martin, there are guests.
I will be back soon.

43
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,633
This five. And five more.

44
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,309
This five. And ten more.

45
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,156
I have a run of luck
now. Ten and twenty more.

46
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,877
I am sorry.

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,872
How can I help you, Sir?

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,151
Miss Mertens, we would like to invite
you to have a glass of wine with us.

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,835
Yes, me too.
- Please, remain seated.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,038
This is very nice of you. But
I am sorry to tell you that

51
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,358
employees are not allowed to accept
invitations. These are the orders.

52
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,073
Or just a nice excuse?

53
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,954
I am sorry to interrupt
your conversation,

54
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,591
but can we continue now? A Royal Flush?

55
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,640
No idea!

56
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,111
Two eights! I'm done.

57
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,714
That was a good one!

58
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,031
Very lucky!

59
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,554
How long do we have
to wait, Miss Mertens?

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,996
I am sorry. I still have to work.

61
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,597
But I am finished! Really finished!
- Don't take it that serious, Baroness!

62
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,076
Unlucky at cards.
- I know, I know!

63
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,078
Stop talking nonsense.

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,709
I would prefer to be unlucky at cards.

65
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,320
And you, Miss Maria?

66
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,511
Me? I don't know much about that.

67
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,872
But about love!
- Please excuse me!

68
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,160
She is such a nice girl.

69
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,398
Yes. And she is only a waitress here.

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,069
What a pitty.
- She is the housekeeper, my friend.

71
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,790
Don Juan is just about to win the race.

72
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,680
But suddenly old Charly says...

73
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,118
What did they want from you?

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,192
Now you start to interrupt
me too, Miss Maria!

75
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,880
Oh Plischke, these old stories!
- What do you mean?

76
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,600
Old stories?

77
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,194
Plischke!
- You are no sportsman at all!

78
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,154
I am a trainer with more
than 30 years of experience.

79
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,273
Plischke, please just tell me
who will win the race tomorrow!

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,232
That's simple. Whoever
has got the right nose.

81
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,040
Since when you are interested
in horses, Mr. Leutner?

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,351
What's your favourite?
- I don't put my money on that.

83
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,557
That's no surprise. You
should know, Mr. Rieger;

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,390
the son of old Mr. Leutner,
the "Turf-Hotel Leutner";

85
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,196
is not very interested
in horses! Not interested!

86
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,159
I bet on "Wildvogel"!
- You really think he can make it?

87
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,033
I beg you pardon, it's my horse!

88
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,839
I don't know if I should trust you.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,673
You should trust me, Baroness.

90
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,757
I must win tomorrow.

91
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,600
Between you and me, Baroness; it would
be cleverer to bet on "Königsleutnant".

92
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,991
It's the favourite, you can't do wrong.

93
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,634
Perfect!

94
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,917
How much do I owe you today?

95
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,673
Very much, I'm afraid.

96
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,520
No surprise.
- But it's not urgent!

97
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,391
Oh no. Gambling debts are
debts of honour. How much?

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,792
You pay in dollars, Baroness?

99
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,594
And you are very curious, my dear
Consul. Why are you talking so loud?

100
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,672
Madam, you don't have to be afraid.

101
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,194
He is right!

102
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,430
Well, I've got dollars.

103
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,836
But I won't pay with them.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,912
Yes, unfortunately.
You are a clever woman.

105
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,120
I agree with you. They should be
kept as an asset of the last resort.

106
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,840
You never know what
is next in these times.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,150
May I have a look?

108
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,835
You can touch them, if you want to.

109
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,193
Interesting paper. I have never
seen something like this in Germany.

110
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,431
Would you be so kind?

111
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,711
I need some dollars. It's urgent.

112
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,872
Oh really? What for?

113
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,077
Madam, now you seem to be indiscreet.

114
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,715
But it is no secret. Especially
not for a horsewoman like you.

115
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,150
"Wildvogel" has to be transported
to Paris via air cargo;

116
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,875
just after the race.

117
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,511
And American Overseas Airlines
only accepts dollars, of course.

118
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,235
But we Germans are not allowed
to own them, as you know!

119
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,313
These times!
- Please, Baroness!

120
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,915
Thank you for your kind
intercession, Count Lorringk!

121
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,958
All right, here they are!

122
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,397
But only for the horse.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,596
Let's say eight Deutschmark. Agreed?

124
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,798
I pay every price!
- All right.

125
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,353
Oh no. As I told you before,
we had just arrived at the loge

126
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,070
when "Don Juan" reached
the finishing straight.

127
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,038
You should have seen his face!

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,394
What you want to tell me is no secret.

129
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,835
Just begin!

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,515
Dear Mr. Plischke wants to
end his story, you must know.

131
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,232
Your constellation is very rare, yes.

132
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,950
Very rare! Uranus is
in opposition to Saturn.

133
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,710
Dear Mr. Quint, I have lived
in opposition for my whole life.

134
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,675
Don't take it too easy.
Remember Wallenstein!

135
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,871
Wallenstein? What do you mean?

136
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,032
You mean the gelding of Mr. Grades?

137
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,396
Of course, you can make fun of me,

138
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,239
but it's not very nice of you.

139
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,034
Take it serious, Mr. Leutner!

140
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,995
Please excuse me! This is the
address you asked for, Mr. Leutner.

141
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,994
Please tell me what time
is it? My watch is slow.

142
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,674
Five minutes past eleven, Mr. Consul!

143
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,480
Waiter, the bill please!
- Thank you, see you later.

144
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,720
Hurry up.

145
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,395
It's not just because of
the stars, Mr. Leutner.

146
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,512
I don't know how to explain.

147
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,633
It's a kind of presentiment. Be careful;

148
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,831
especially for the next days.

149
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,919
Enough is enough, Mr. Quint!
- Please believe me, you are in danger!

150
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,396
Waiter, where are you?
- I'm on my way!

151
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,834
Short before finish, the horse boggles!

152
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,352
Well, what's going on, waiter?

153
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,240
Pardon, excuse me, Sir!

154
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,795
No good waiters around these days.

155
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,350
Pardon?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

156
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,392
Is the kitchen still open, Miss Maria?

157
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,074
No. But that is no problem.

158
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,910
A Sweden plate at this time. For
the select society in the pink room.

159
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,117
We can do it on our own, Zühlke.

160
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,351
Why don't you like these people?

161
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,877
I don't know why. They
make me feel uncomfortable.

162
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,390
Well, all of the
Turf-People are very special.

163
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,279
At least on the eve of a big race.

164
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,357
There is something about this
group of people, I don't like.

165
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,517
We can't afford to choose
our guests at these times.

166
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,070
And they pay well.

167
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,630
My dear Consul, I don't believe
in your favourite "Königsleutnant"!

168
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,872
He can't keep up the
distance with his weight.

169
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,151
That's your opinion. You can
lead a horse to water...

170
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,392
Good night, dear Mr.
Zühlke. Do you bet tomorrow?

171
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,480
Of course, Baroness. "Wildvogel"
will win! It's Consul Pallant's horse.

172
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,951
As I said! And now Zühlke as well!
- I think I am outvoted by now!

173
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,995
Is it allowed to invite
you outside the hotel?

174
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,276
Maybe tomorrow for the race?

175
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't think my principal
would like to see that.

176
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,470
What a pity. Good night!
- Good night!

177
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,351
Good night, Baroness!
- Good night!

178
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,440
Sometimes I envy you in
many ways. But I like you!

179
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,472
Good night, Mr. Consul!
- Good night, Baroness!

180
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,520
You are charming! Good night!

181
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,160
Good night! Good night!

182
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,840
Mr. Zühlke, do you think you
could convince Mr. Leutner

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,515
to listen to my advice?
- I'm afraid not, Mr. Quint.

184
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,873
Mr. Leutner has no faith in the
stars. Just come on... Stop!

185
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,599
Mrs. Leutner!
- May I?

186
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,597
What is it?

187
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,197
A betting slip for
"Königsleutnant". He will win!

188
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,515
I can't take it.

189
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,956
You will win 1.000 Deutschmark at least.

190
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,560
That is very noble but...

191
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,672
There is always a "but"
for you, Miss Maria!

192
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,480
I can't take it.
- I knew you would say that.

193
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,917
You know, you are...

194
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,995
Excuse me, Mrs. Leutner knocks.

195
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,672
How can I help you; Miss Maria?

196
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,835
She is marvellous.
Compared to you, Miss Czoch.

197
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,511
Oh la la! What is your point?

198
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,637
I'll tell you.

199
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,195
What do you think? Who
is the winner tomorrow?

200
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,472
You should know. You are in
contact with these people.

201
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,916
Should I ask the Consul again?

202
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,116
No!

203
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,074
Is my son at the restaurant?
- I don't know.

204
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,475
And you don't know too, right?

205
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,711
Maybe Mr. Leutner is at the phone.

206
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,719
I didn't ask you, Zühlke!
I don't need you anymore.

207
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,997
11:15 o'clock, strange. And you
really don't know where Martin is?

208
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,191
No.
- That's a lie!

209
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,511
A lie?
- Of course!

210
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,151
Each night Martin disappears
exactly at the same time.

211
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,792
Something is wrong here.
- I don't understand.

212
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,792
I can tell you where he is!

213
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,596
Upstairs. In your room!

214
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,155
Keeps on crafting.

215
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,960
Oh, this damned radio device,
he took from the attic.

216
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,477
And you? You even helped him.

217
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,354
You got the radio tube
for him, from this Consul.

218
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,434
Although you now that it's forbidden.
I should have burned the whole stuff

219
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,960
before he returned!

220
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,673
But I want to know now:
What is he doing there? What?

221
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,920
And for whom?

222
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,320
That may cost his life, I fear!

223
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,518
But he needs it. He is so
lucky, when he is upstairs.

224
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:38,271
Lucky? So he is not
lucky if he is with me?

225
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,070
Please understand. Martin is not the
right man for a hotel and will never be.

226
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,600
He'll learn!

227
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,280
Not Martin. He is afraid of people.

228
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,319
Afraid of people? Why?

229
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,711
Since war, since he came back.

230
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,918
You talk that into him! You
want him to leave me! Me!

231
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,952
And the hotel, that is what you want!

232
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,396
You know exactly that this is not true.

233
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,319
Come to me.

234
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,879
Sit down.

235
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,240
Maria, you have helped me so much, took

236
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,798
care of me, took my place
at the hotel, I know that.

237
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,154
And you waited for Martin to return
for so many years. Waited faithfully.

238
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,472
While he was away, everything went fine.

239
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,190
But now...
- Now he is back again!

240
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,111
Yes, but in what condition?

241
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,839
I can understand you, Maria.

242
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,639
I know what it's like,
if men pay attention.

243
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,037
But tell me why you hired
this new waiter, Wiegler?

244
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,510
Because we needed him. And
he seemed to be competent.

245
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,798
Oh no, there is something
else. And I'll tell you:

246
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,992
Because he is young and handsome. He
looks at you in a very special way.

247
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,440
Stop that!
- No!

248
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,871
Martin is my son. He is
all I've got in this world.

249
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,595
And I will not allow you to
humiliate him, to hurt him.

250
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,400
Maybe you don't want to. But
I can see how much he suffers.

251
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,480
I love Martin. And Martin
loves me. Any questions?

252
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,274
You will destroy him.
Destroy everything.

253
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,837
Why did you bring
this man here? Tell me!

254
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,872
Don't be such a coward!

255
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,479
Was it very hard?

256
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,872
Take it easy. You look more
beautiful if you are not worried.

257
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,839
As a long-term waiter; you start
to look behind the clothing.

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,832
Even behind black silk and frills.

259
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,032
And what do you see behind it?
- You want to know?

260
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,519
A poor soul. And with such a
great affection to Mr. Leutner,

261
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,115
like you show; you should
be able to see it, too.

262
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,680
The seven is up, Brosen.
Stop that tinkling.

263
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,517
No tinkleling, I work! Learn how to
send Morse codes for Pallant and Company.

264
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,519
But please put your stuff in a safe
place, especially the decipher-codes!

265
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,080
Are you mad?

266
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,674
May I have a look?
- Away!

267
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,400
Stop that, Lipinsky! Don't pretend!

268
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,756
Is there anything you want me to know?

269
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,357
Me? No. But wait...

270
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,551
Well, you might be interested in that.

271
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,518
With cushion?
- What do you think?

272
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,593
I never play direct. Now have a look.

273
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,033
Respect. Well done.

274
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,874
Yes, I'm good in combining.
Not only in billards.

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,074
Right, Lipinsky? And do you know
by now what you wanted to tell me?

276
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,669
What is it?
- It's his turn.

277
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,079
Are you so stupid or
do you just pretend?

278
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,154
All specialists are stupid.
Nevertheless you should wear gloves.

279
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,953
And be more careful.

280
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,477
I am careful. I just need
to get something for my work.

281
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,953
Really? So what exactly do
you need, Lipinsky? What is it?

282
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,470
You live a pretty good life and I pay.

283
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,792
Do you need money? 50 Deutschmark?
100 Deutschmark? 1.000 Deutschmark?

284
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,354
You know, I'm not ungenerous.

285
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,638
I want everybody to stay in
line. This is a big thing.

286
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,598
He has no idea about a "big thing".

287
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,752
So I have to explain it again.

288
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,155
As you know, it's all about
the dollar that is socked away.

289
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,431
Maybe, but where is my part of it?

290
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,114
We share everything.

291
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,152
I've heard the rumors.

292
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,471
Lots of money was lost.

293
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,792
Right. But now we make
this special offer:

294
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,872
Safe all your dollars for a rainy day.

295
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,957
And if the people learn about
the counterfeited dollars?

296
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,037
Idiot!

297
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,916
That is the best part of the story. The
people have to keep their mouths shut.

298
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,192
At least here.
- Because it's forbidden to own dollars!

299
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,120
That is why we do it
in Germany. Stupid guy!

300
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,880
Military court is not a funny place.
- That's right!

301
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,238
Listen everybody!
Especially you, Mr. Lipinsky!

302
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,995
Your printing plates are
excellent, that's true.

303
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,918
Really? And why are they in Paris then?

304
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,958
Because we can't get
the right paper here.

305
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,679
Understood?

306
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,277
No! Because you want to make
the deal there, without me!

307
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,840
Because you want to betray me!

308
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,595
Idiot! What use are
the dollars in Paris?

309
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,719
If the police finds them, they'll
stop the whole derby!

310
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,559
But then it's useless anyway!

311
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,399
In a foreign country: yes. But not here.

312
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,557
That is why we take
the money to Germany.

313
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,680
Dollar-Import in large scale.
And the people will hide them.

314
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,871
Understood?

315
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,393
And who tells me that this is true?
I can't trust you. None of you!

316
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,960
Not even this guy upstairs!

317
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,351
Leutner? He has no idea
about what is going on.

318
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,480
Me neither. That is why I want
to decipher everything on my own.

319
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,757
I want to know what's
going on with the dollars!

320
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,798
You don't make big deals
by mistrusting us, Lipinsky!

321
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,350
And not by recklessness as
well. He is up there, all alone.

322
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,512
How do you know that he
won't tell the police?

323
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,593
You are too stupid, Lipinsky.
Even you should know:

324
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,319
Building a radio devise is...?
- Forbidden!

325
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,039
Using it?
- Forbidden!

326
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,920
Don't be afraid, he is on our side.

327
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,359
Martin? What is wrong?

328
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,034
This guy outside!
- Who?

329
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,319
Useless. He is gone.

330
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,399
I could have catched him...

331
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,233
Or seen his face at least!

332
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,556
By the way; what are you
doing here? At this time?

333
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,552
What a stupid question, Martin.

334
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,394
What a coincidence; just seconds
after he tried to get in here?

335
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,554
Relax. What happened?

336
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,279
And what has it got to do with me?

337
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,318
For how long is this going on? This
guy started to work here 14 days ago.

338
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,757
Who?
- Wiegler! I think it was him!

339
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,116
He wanted to get into your room.

340
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,352
Tried to be careful, this fine man.

341
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,399
And he didn't see you?
- Stop pretending!

342
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,791
You can tell me that you've
had an appointment with him.

343
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,470
You laugh? You laugh? Stop it!
- But I have to laugh, Martin!

344
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,115
If you don't want to believe
me, think it over again.

345
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,277
I know exactly that you
are here; every night

346
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,039
at the same time, in my room.

347
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,316
Because it was my idea.

348
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,397
Do you really think that I would
arrange a secret date with my lover

349
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,199
here; at this time?

350
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,273
But it was him.
- You might have been wrong.

351
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,799
And what were you doing here?

352
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,038
Some private minutes with you. I'm
on my way back from your mother.

353
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,472
She knows everything. Nobody
told her, but she knows it.

354
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,676
What does she know?

355
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,958
That you have this radio device. And
that want to leave this place and study.

356
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,679
So?
- She doesn't want you to leave.

357
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,759
She is afraid to loose
you. She is very lonely.

358
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,715
What can I do?

359
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,559
Go your own way. I'll go with you.

360
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,399
You'll come with me.

361
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,717
Dear Consul, each time you
kiss me, something is wrong!

362
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,631
You are clever. But I
can't stop kissing you.

363
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,279
That's true. We are bonded
by our work and hope.

364
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,950
All that fuss about the money.
Why are we still sitting around?

365
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,072
Because Pallant is here with his horse.

366
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,590
And because it's a safe place among
all these horse freaks and adventurers.

367
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,195
Apart from that I love this hotel
with its conservative clientele.

368
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,518
The perfect background,
if you know what I mean?

369
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,273
But that means nothing
to you, I suppose.

370
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,671
Weasel words! My dollars are real!

371
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,031
Nobody took notice until now.

372
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,639
What? You put some proof
copies into circulation here?

373
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,558
Just a test.
- A test!

374
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,718
Tonight our dollars will
cross the border. Loads of it!

375
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,514
Printed on flawless paper! I am waiting
for the radio message every minute!

376
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,195
And you think that this is
the right moment for a test?

377
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,510
Risk everything?

378
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,431
Calm down!

379
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,274
I was just afraid you might...

380
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,551
Lipinsky, listen to
me, you have one hour.

381
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,440
Understood? One hour.

382
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,517
If there is only one of
your dollars in the hotel,

383
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,512
Max will take you out for a little walk.

384
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,474
The lady resides in
room 16. Are we clear?

385
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,274
That's impossible! I'm afraid!

386
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,597
Max! Give him a drink to encourage him!

387
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,240
Come on!
- No, no.

388
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,273
Cordy, take care that nobody interrupts!

389
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,636
Waiter!

390
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,710
Mr. Leutner?

391
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,951
Where have you been?
- When, Mr. Leutner?

392
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,554
About ten minutes ago.

393
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,518
I was here, Mr. Leutner.

394
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,353
Really?
- Yes.

395
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,037
You have been at the
restaurant for the whole time?

396
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,238
Yes. Of course. Where
else should I have been?

397
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,993
That is not true!

398
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,116
Do you want to tell me that I'm a lier?

399
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,033
I have seen you upstairs
with my very own eyes!

400
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,790
Upstairs? Maybe a mistake, Mr. Leutner.

401
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,429
Maybe an illusion?

402
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,760
It's okay.

403
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,911
Let him breathe!

404
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,116
Attention!

405
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,078
Is Mr. Lipinsky sick?
- No, he's fine!

406
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,477
Almost too well. Just a
joke. How was the reception?

407
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,632
Very poor, many interruptions.

408
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,952
Really poor. I mean, for
such an important day.

409
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,958
Come on, Cordy, let's go to work!

410
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,314
Waiter, another beer please!

411
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,394
And you really don't know
what Mr. Leutner meant earlier?

412
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,954
No idea.

413
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,197
I thought you are such a clever guy.

414
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,797
Maybe not. I am very sorry.

415
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,270
That was no coincidence.
- Why should I?

416
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,272
Why do you want to
avoid a proper answer?

417
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,636
Mr. Leutner saw you upstairs.
- Me? Where?

418
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,315
And you don't feel bad about it?

419
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,233
Not at all, why should I?

420
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,672
Why have you tried to get into my room?
- I have never been into your room!

421
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,072
Only on my way to it.
I was at the canopy.

422
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,795
And you dare to tell me that?

423
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,839
Of course!
- And why?

424
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,312
Get some fresh air! Take a walk.

425
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,796
Yes, and get a little glimpse of you.

426
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,670
A private one. How should
I say that to Mr. Leutner?

427
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,112
Oh!
- Here is your little glimpse of me!

428
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,670
I am sorry!
- Now I am really angry with you!

429
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,355
I can't believe that.
- What do you mean?

430
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,677
When will you say the truth?

431
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
You will learn about the truth.

432
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,040
Soon enough, Miss Maria.

433
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,510
Leave me; the dress is dry enough now.

434
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,433
Not dry enough.
- Waiter?

435
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,116
I am sorry to interrupt. What
a waiter! Flirting around!

436
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,198
While the guests have to wait!

437
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,551
What took you so long, Wiegler?

438
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,474
Mr. Rieger needs cigarettes
and I am sold out!

439
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,036
An urgent call, Mr. Zühlke.

440
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,800
Hurry, hurry, we need two more
bottles. Same label, right?

441
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,191
Very interesting!

442
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,870
Wiegler!

443
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,591
So you lied to me earlier?

444
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,319
No, Mr. Leutner!

445
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,830
But I never thought that
you'll get to know it so fast.

446
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,152
So you confess...
- That I made a call, yes.

447
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,752
Why did you try to get
into Miss Mertens room?

448
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,712
Guess why?
- Martin!

449
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,200
I was in front of the room, not
inside! You know that, Mr. Leutner!

450
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,194
Don't be too bold!

451
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,717
Why? I am interested in proper
racing hints as well...

452
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,070
On which frequency you are
transmitting, Mr. Leutner?

453
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,237
You try to blackmail
me? This is intolerable!

454
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,356
You are fired! Go!
- Martin!

455
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,199
Listen to me, you are out!

456
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,631
Understood, Mr. Leutner!

457
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,877
I will ask for my papers tomorrow.

458
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,635
Miss Mertens will give
them to you immediately.

459
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,116
Maria, give him his papers!

460
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,079
Am I allowed to encash in the pink room?

461
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,471
Why? The pink room
is Zühlke's territory.

462
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,597
I am sorry, Mr. Leutner.
There are still some bills left

463
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,399
from the last days.
- Martin.

464
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,960
Leave me alone!

465
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,031
What have you transmitted today?
- Some long champs hints for the next days.

466
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,159
What? Nothing else?
- No. Mr. Lipinsky, nothing else!

467
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,549
What do you want from me, waiter?

468
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,594
I have to excuse me, Mr. Consul,
there are some things...

469
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,558
I have to encash now.
- I don't have time for that now.

470
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,995
Come back later.

471
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,311
Of course, Mr. Consul, as you like.

472
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,395
I don't like him, I can't help myself.

473
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,677
I think he is very handsome.

474
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,912
But very curious.

475
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,309
What do you mean?

476
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,200
Nothing.
- Don't fool me.

477
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,920
He is a blackmailer.
- No, stop talking nonsense!

478
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,390
What? And who is he blackmailing?

479
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,711
Leutner! He caught him
while he was transmitting.

480
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,872
Really a nice hotel!
- Shut up!

481
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,273
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
- I like surprises!

482
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,600
Your champagne, Mr. Consul.
- Finally, Zühlke!

483
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,998
Excuse me, Mr. Consul,
but Mrs. Leutner asked for

484
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,595
your hints for tomorrow.

485
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,080
Right, I'm on my way.

486
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,670
Here!
- Thank you!

487
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,160
Really nice of you
to help me out, Count.

488
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,433
Hurry up, Wiegler,

489
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,637
maybe she can help me out, too.

490
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,195
Let's see. Do you prefer dollars?

491
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,838
Be careful, Wiegler, sometimes
there are very strange surprises!

492
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,395
Count.

493
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,436
Hello?

494
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,840
Oh, I am very sorry, Baroness!

495
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,720
I didn't ring for the
waiter. How can I help you?

496
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,757
Baroness...

497
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,470
Please, don't look in my direction.
It's past eleven, well, no...

498
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,716
Of course, Baroness! I
feel a bit embarrassed.

499
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,191
I don't know how to begin.
- You don't seem to be a laggard?

500
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,113
Baroness, you have always
been very kind to me.

501
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,512
So I thought, I mean, maybe...?

502
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,279
Well, my dear? By the
way; you look marvellous!

503
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,790
I haven't notice that before.

504
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,874
Baroness, you look beautiful
too, if I may say so.

505
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,474
What enlightenment!

506
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,757
I asked you before not to look
at me, but you do it again.

507
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,439
I am a lady and it is in
the middle of the night.

508
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,677
Excuse me, Baroness.

509
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,556
Earlier I saw that Baroness
paid Consul Pallant in dollars.

510
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,837
That's what you saw? You
haven't been there at all.

511
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,515
I have a good memory
for things like that.

512
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,916
How can you dare to
say things like that?

513
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,235
Please, Baroness, listen to me.

514
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,198
I'd like to make a suggestion.

515
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,113
Leave me alone!
- I know!

516
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,193
You don't spend dollars.
You save them for rainy days.

517
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,875
But maybe Baroness can
make an exception for me.

518
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,953
Now, that I kow everything. I
need some dollars, very urgent.

519
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,592
I pay every price. For a little deal,
you know what I mean. But I need them now.

520
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,919
Well, now I think that you
were really listening earlier.

521
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,353
I had almost the same
conversation then, very funny!

522
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,597
How much do you pay?

523
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,959
Nine Deutschmarks?
- Nine? Of course!

524
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,156
That's lots of money!

525
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,791
I never do deals like that, but...

526
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,192
But you do it as a favour
to me, Baroness, how lovely!

527
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,431
And how much can Baroness offer me?

528
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,233
25 and you pay immediately!

529
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,279
25, of course. Yes, I've
got the money with me.

530
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,720
Is it possible to give
me some more, Baroness?

531
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,800
No, I'm sorry. But why don't
you ask your night porter?

532
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,957
No. Glinka?

533
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,919
Yes, Glinka. Strange that
you don't know about that.

534
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,039
Well, where are they, my little friends?

535
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,717
Ah yes, here they are. Just a moment.
Strange that you don't know. Really.

536
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,351
26 x 9, that is 225
Deutschmark in total.

537
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,476
You can multiply that
by mental arithmetic?

538
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,950
Of course. I'm sure you can do so
as well, Baroness. Here you are!

539
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,793
50.
- 100.

540
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,634
Baroness is very well known
for her gentleness...

541
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:54,479
You are so charming, my
dear! 120, 140, 60, 180...

542
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,109
I remember you on the cover
of the "Dame"-magazine.

543
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,476
Baroness as a
show-jumper. Really great.

544
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,277
Yes. Well?
- 200, 10, 20.

545
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,596
Thank you, keep the rest.
- I am so thankful!

546
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,120
Here are your dollars.

547
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,593
This is the end of our nice little
transaction by night, isn't it?

548
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,357
Keep that confidential!
- Of course, Baroness.

549
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,638
It's in my own best interest.
Thank you again and good night.

550
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,120
Good night.

551
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,959
By the way, Baroness, if I
may give you a good advice:

552
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,795
Lock up your door, yes?
- Why should I?

553
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,555
So many things happen today.

554
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,350
You are so boring, always
playing at billiards!

555
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,552
And nobody cares about me!

556
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,077
Well, Lipinskychen? Have a
drink! That will be good for you!

557
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,316
Thank you.

558
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,915
Wasn't there something you
wanted to do, Mr. Lipinsky?

559
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,800
Maybe the Lady in room
16 isn't asleep yet?

560
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,749
She would like to be disturbed.
- Yes, if I have to?

561
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,679
I think you have.

562
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,237
Good evening, good night.

563
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,915
I don't understand you.
Why did you do that earlier?

564
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,471
Do you have a moment?
- If I have to.

565
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,755
Help, Help! Now I should help you!

566
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,071
First you behave so bad that Mr.
Leutner has to dismiss you and now.

567
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,476
I'm afraid I can't do anything for you.

568
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,154
But Maria, what can I do now?

569
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,152
If you are out on the
street these days...

570
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,596
When did you start to work as a waiter?
- Why do you ask?

571
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,433
Are you not satisfied with me?

572
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,798
It depends; you are very different
compared to other waiters.

573
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,599
Yes, because I am no ordinary man.

574
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,480
That is why I have been dismissed my
whole life through. It started in school.

575
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,151
And continued with your waiter education?
- Oh well, yes, my waiter education.

576
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,755
I nearly forgot about
that. I haven't got one.

577
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,076
Pardon?

578
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,914
You know, I went to sea and during
that period I had to work as a steward.

579
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,952
The real one had appendicitis.

580
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,316
Yes, but nobody found out
because of the heavy sea.

581
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,960
And other circumstances.

582
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,596
And then we were at war.

583
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,959
I was a soldier. When war was over,
everything else was over for me, too.

584
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,715
I did some things here and there.

585
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,190
You know, what people
use to do after war.

586
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,915
And where are these
premium certificates from?

587
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,517
These are first-class addresses:
Stageclub Berlin, the "Bär" in Wiesbaden?

588
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,558
Well, Miss Maria, certificates.
Nothing but paper, isn't it?

589
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,952
I knew some people there.

590
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,038
Especially some female ones.

591
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,072
You know that I am a respectable guy.

592
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,477
And if you try to get a new
start, to build up a new life,

593
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,035
you do things like that.

594
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,194
Well, but what have you done upstairs
earlier? Are you a spy? Say something!

595
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,039
Explain yourself!

596
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,353
Excuse me, Miss Maria.
There is nothing to explain.

597
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,118
I can't tell you anything else.

598
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,391
Please believe me. I am a good guy.

599
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,273
Mr. Wegener, do you
know what you ask of me?

600
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,591
I know. But I have tp
repeat it: Please help me!

601
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,399
Let me stay here. Yes?

602
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,232
All right, I'll do my best.
But I can't promise you.

603
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,390
I know.

604
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,512
And you don't deserve it.

605
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,798
Sit down.

606
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,433
She sat next to me, just like you now.

607
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,716
And now it has happened.

608
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,475
What do you mean mother? What happened?

609
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,712
I dismissed the new
waiter, nothing else.

610
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,270
You don't need to explain it, my boy.

611
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,032
Things had to end like that.
- I don't understand?

612
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,719
Do you mean... Maria...

613
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,720
I don't mean nothing.
You already know it.

614
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,714
That's the point. I know
nothing. And now you behave like

615
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,872
it's over between me and Maria.

616
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,752
Even if it's over, my boy;

617
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:57,073
you and I stay together.

618
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,279
Sorry to interrupt you, Madame,

619
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,278
but Mr. Zühlke told me that you
are interested in my opinion.

620
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,716
About the race tomorrow.
- Oh, Zühlke, this old tattler.

621
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,719
Do you think that Mr. Leutner is
all serious about the dismissal?

622
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,679
I'm afraid, yes. I feel sorry for him.

623
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,198
Me too. But to be blunt, he
is not the best waiter in town.

624
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,831
He is still very young
and not experienced enough.

625
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,600
Martin, you come with me, won't
you? This is our last night.

626
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,672
After the race tomorrow
there won't be much going on.

627
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,314
We can celebrate a little.

628
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,996
I'm not in the mood for that, but
there is somethig we need to talk about.

629
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,680
Come with me then. Good night, Madame.

630
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,075
So you knew exactly how
the race would turn out?

631
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,079
Sure! You see, the trainer knows

632
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,669
how elastic the race ground is.

633
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,354
Martin, I have to talk to you.

634
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,159
Hey, don't look so scowl!

635
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,999
Look at me, and then you
have to laugh for sure.

636
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,356
Well, I don't seem to be
too successful in that.

637
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,275
I will follow you in a second.
- Interesting!

638
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,758
Well, Miss Maria, not
finished with the billing?

639
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,190
No.
- Tomorrow's just another day, isn't it?

640
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,670
Don't be angry with me, but all
the arrangements for tomorrow

641
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,394
and the house is fully booked...

642
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,432
But I can't have my farewell
party without you, Maria?

643
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,552
I hope you will weather
the storm, Mr. Consul?

644
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,756
Barely.

645
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,157
Would you please turn
off the ceiling lighting?

646
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,993
Do you need some dim light, Cordy?

647
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,918
You are right!
- That's fine, Miss Czoch.

648
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,600
A farewell party with
dim light, that's nice.

649
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,951
Well, Mr. Leutner; horse races,

650
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,720
they are always very exciting
for me and my friends.

651
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,638
And somehow befogging.

652
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,436
My lovelies, this is really great. I am
previously convicted in the matter of love.

653
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,994
What do you think about that?

654
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,959
Before you haven't seen a
finish with all its excitement,

655
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,349
I mean on the race course...

656
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,474
I am previously convicted
in the matter of love.

657
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,991
Tell me, is that really necessary?
- I like it.

658
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,271
Mr. Martin, I wanted to join a
theatre group earlier, did you know?

659
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,471
I am the Christel from the Post Office!

660
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,320
All right. Well, Mr.
Martin, listen to me:

661
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,512
You have to place a bet!
Then you will be a part of us.

662
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,832
Believe me, it will be the best
thing to do in your situation.

663
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,758
As far as I can evaluate
the situation in here...

664
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,759
Well, that fits you exactly.
- How do you know?

665
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,271
So be careful, very careful, young man.

666
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,591
Oh Max, if only you could
just play the piano as well.

667
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,677
You can win a fortune if you
do the pools with my help.

668
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,520
Then you can study. Excuse
me for being so blunt,

669
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,919
but you can even get married
then, without your mothers support.

670
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,838
Think of Miss Maria...

671
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,839
This is tailor-made for me, isn't it?

672
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,555
That's why I don't want
to get started with you!

673
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,036
You don't need to be so jealous, Martin.

674
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,192
Yes, but...
- Such a beautiful lady;

675
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,358
why shouldn't she live out her wishes?

676
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,039
Really? Are you sure?

677
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,793
Listen to me, you boring guys!

678
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,120
The first line is a smasher: Give
me a period of probation tonight.

679
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,398
If it starts like that,
it's over with fidelity.

680
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,837
Fidelity? That gives one a horse laugh!
Fidelity is only a poetically term!

681
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,758
No, that's not true!
- Would you please tell me why?

682
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,200
A toast to fidelity!

683
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,152
Yes, to fidelity.

684
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,036
You, Miss Cordy, a toast to fidelity?

685
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,954
Of course not! You must be kidding!

686
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,119
A toast to love! To its
beginning and its end!

687
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,272
You have a voice in the
chapter as well, don't you?

688
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,070
However, let's drink to love!
To its beginning and its end!

689
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,314
And to the beautiful Miss Maria!
- You like her as well, don't you?

690
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,592
Good Lord, how could I
deny? She is very pretty.

691
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,996
You have to admit that, don't you?

692
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,958
By the way, you know well enough that
Maria makes all of us a little crazy.

693
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,197
However, unfortunately I'm not her type.

694
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:32,112
You have to look different,
I'm afraid. Tall, dark, slim.

695
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,993
And much younger!

696
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,757
I am previously
convicted in case of love!

697
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,873
So be careful, very careful, young man.

698
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,996
Opportunity makes a
thief, as the saying goes.

699
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,232
That's why I don't get started with you!

700
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,156
Nevertheless I can't
conceal that my blood

701
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,076
is almost kleptomaniac.

702
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,750
If I like a heart, I have to steal it.

703
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:15,436
Give me a period of probation tonight!

704
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,155
Stop that, enough!
- Why?

705
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,714
What do you think?

706
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,758
Stop talking about Maria like that!

707
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,195
I must be drunk. I don't
want to listen to you anymore!

708
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,760
I wanted to say something
completely different to you:

709
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,037
Until now I have transmitted
these racings hints for you.

710
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,271
I want to stop that,
I can't do it anymore!

711
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,512
I don't need any racing hints!
- Maybe the waiter needs them?

712
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,792
But what for?
- Maybe for a woman?

713
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,272
Beautiful ladies are expensive.

714
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,119
You may be right. I saw
him in front of Marias room.

715
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,072
And he asked me about the frequency.

716
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,672
The Frequency?
- Very interesting!

717
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,873
Really interesting!
- But I won't put up with that!

718
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,033
I dismissed him!
- That's right!

719
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,112
Calm down, Martin!

720
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,840
You saw him in front of Marias room?

721
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,994
There might be other reasons for
that. Private reasons, I mean.

722
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,517
Do you really think...
- Yes.

723
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,233
A glass of champagne
will be good for you.

724
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,115
Zühlke!

725
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,509
Champagne!
- And you are my guests!

726
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,359
Good idea, I'm with you!

727
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,439
All of you, my friends!

728
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,591
Pardon!
- What's going on out there?

729
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,275
Martin is quite upset. He
drank more than he should have.

730
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,750
Now he has ordered champagne
for all the people over there!

731
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,673
For the Consul?
- Yes, although he is not allowed to drink!

732
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,632
As you know, his eye!
- The champagne is exhausted!

733
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,713
Not one bottle left! Go and tell Zühlke!

734
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,436
It's draughty, close that door!

735
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,232
The champagne is exhausted.

736
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,199
No champagne? Go and get some, Zühlke!

737
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,551
The next delivery is tomorrow.

738
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,278
What about the dollars? Stop
telling stories, come on!

739
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,669
You know me.

740
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,832
Well, Glinka, you are
completely out of it?

741
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,435
Mr. Wiegler, I really
don't know what you mean?

742
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,155
Don't mind, I need more dollars!
And I know that you've got more!

743
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,749
Really, Wiegler, I don't have any!

744
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,560
But you've had some.
Tell me about the source.

745
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,837
No, Wiegler, don't ask for it.

746
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,038
I will never betray
a business associate!

747
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,920
All right, as you like.

748
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,111
But don't ask me about
further racing hints anymore.

749
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,038
Come on, speak frankly, won't you?

750
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,554
You are right.

751
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,637
We must stick together.

752
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,237
I'm sorry, but I can't do that!
No, it's a business secret!

753
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,596
Well, as you like, Glinka.
It that's your last word.

754
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,511
It's over! It's over!
Everything's over! We're trapped!

755
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,154
Shut the door please! Who?

756
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,671
Who trapped us?
- The waiter! The new one!

757
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,719
I saw it from the stairs! He
is on the scent of our dollars!

758
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,240
He started with Glinka.

759
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,754
Be quiet, please.

760
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,837
So he wants our dollars?
- Yes!

761
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,872
And you brought us into that!

762
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,793
Where are the dollars now?

763
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,913
I didn't get them! Miss
Rotttach's room was locked!

764
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,630
Now you get your
comeuppance for this mess!

765
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,917
It is your mess as well as mine!

766
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,640
Acid, you can't wash it away;
it browses through your skin.

767
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,393
Then you can't pretend
to be a gentleman anymore.

768
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,074
But why did I manufacture
that printing plates

769
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,469
if I'm not allowed to spend the dollars?

770
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,796
You will spend 15 years in
prison if you go on like that.

771
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,512
That's not enough. They are
looking for us all over Europe.

772
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,515
Well meant, very well
meant! Because you love me?

773
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,717
You want to make a fool out of me!

774
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,793
But you are wrong! I am a man;

775
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,553
I can take care of myself!

776
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,316
Wiegler! Yes, you are meant, come here!

777
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,357
Bring me a bottle from the cellar!

778
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,035
There is nothing left!
- Leave!

779
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,237
Well, if there's nothing
left, I don't need to go.

780
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,312
By the way, Mr.
Leutner; do you remember:

781
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,199
I am not part of your staff anymore!

782
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,674
So what are you doing here?

783
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,355
Excuse me; I have to wait
for this people to pay.

784
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,199
Has the concierge told
him where he got it from?

785
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,953
I don't think so,
Glinka is very reliable.

786
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,998
You think Wiegler has got them by now?
- For sure!

787
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,157
Either we have to escape or
Wiegler has to disappear tonight!

788
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,714
I don't do that, I'm not a murderer!

789
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,349
Do you think I am? My friend,
I am the leader in here!

790
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,915
It would be very strange
to disappear right away.

791
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,992
We have to solve this problem.

792
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,396
First thing is to take care of Wiegler!

793
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,994
Shut up!

794
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,079
You will pay for your boldness!

795
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,749
Very interesting, all of this!
- Leave this place!

796
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,794
I want to leave! I want to cross the
border! When will the new delivery arrive?

797
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,429
Tonight!
- You are really mad!

798
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,320
Idiot! This is about our lives and
you are asking about the dollars!

799
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,834
Rubbish, you just want
to hide it from me!

800
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,830
Of course you will get paid!
The waiter has to get paid!

801
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,276
Mr. Wiegler?
- Yes, I'm here.

802
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,911
Right, Mr. Wiegler, there are some
liabilities to pay from last night.

803
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,072
No problem, Mr. Consul.

804
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,834
Two cognacs, two packages
of cigarettes, two mochas.

805
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,310
It's because I have
to leave immediately.

806
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,040
What's going on outside?
Are you involved?

807
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,311
I am dismissed.

808
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,512
So pretty and so quickly dismissed.

809
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,797
Am I allowed to ask why?
- There are several reasons.

810
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,236
And there are nine Cognacs left
from the night before yesterday.

811
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,794
And three packages of
cigarettes and four mocha.

812
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,196
There is always a reason if
you need one. You know that.

813
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,829
But someone like you?
They should keep you!

814
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,993
In total 23, 80 Deutschmark,
if I may, Mr. Consul.

815
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,551
Keep the change.
- Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Consul.

816
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,310
Seriously, Mr. Wiegler, why
has Mr. Leutner dismissed you?

817
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,393
I just ask, because...

818
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,473
I mean, my opinion counts in here.

819
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,632
Oh, you are so friendly, Mr. Consul.

820
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,110
But it's useless, I'm afraid.

821
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,431
You are the reason, Mr. Consul.

822
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,319
Now it's getting interesting.

823
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,431
Well, tell me all about it.

824
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,756
I wasn't born yesterday!
Or do you think I'm stupid?

825
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,277
I don't believe that Mr. Leutner is
transmitting harmless racing hints for you.

826
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,999
Well? As I said!

827
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,712
I see.

828
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,719
I wouldn't say no to a small
additional income as well.

829
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,400
We all could need some
money, couldn't we?

830
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,194
But someone like him. It's
all because of other women.

831
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,800
All right, all right.

832
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,271
So what do you want? I
mean, in case of Mr. Leutner

833
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,715
and our racing hints?

834
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,832
That's very simple, Mr. Consul.

835
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,953
With a short-wave transmitter
you know much earlier than the

836
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,430
turf accountants which horses have won.

837
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,040
Oh boy, that would be nice!

838
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,476
Good guy! You can learn from him!

839
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,475
So you think that Mr. Leutner is trans-
mitting this kind of information for us?

840
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,671
Maybe he receives them
as well! It depends.

841
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,269
You are very clever!

842
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,035
You should have become
a private investigator.

843
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,352
Really? I wanted to,
but it was impossible.

844
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,477
What a pity.
- Touché!

845
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,911
You know, I like you, my friend.

846
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,232
You really think that
we are impostors, yes?

847
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,869
Well, your fantasy is really
playing games with you.

848
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,919
Mr. Consul, I would never
use my knowledge against you.

849
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,676
How nice. But I have to disappoint you.

850
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,833
There is no way for you to
get involved. We only get

851
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,310
legal hints from foreign countries.

852
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,393
I can assure you that it's worth it.

853
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,395
We are very decent.

854
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,917
Bring us five bottles of champagne.
- I go and tell Mr. Zühlke.

855
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,711
No, there is no real Derby-mood today.

856
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,799
It was different in the past time. When the
old Mr. Leutner was still alive, you know?

857
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,439
Wait a moment, dear Plischke,
it's over there...

858
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,751
Gentlemen, you asked for the bill?
- The bill? No, not me.

859
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,436
He lied to me!

860
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,200
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but it's already late

861
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,273
and I have to do the till. And all
these preparations for tomorrow!

862
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,716
Why do you insist on Wiegler to go?

863
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,758
What is the text please?

864
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,877
May I invite you, dear Plischke?

865
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,953
If Wiegler goes, nothing will change!
You will look for another reason

866
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,510
and you will find one!
- Too bad that I will find one!

867
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,990
You will look for it! First it was
all about the guests, now it's Wiegler,

868
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,356
later on it will be because of another guest.
- You are the reason, Maria!

869
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,631
No, you are, Martin! And the hotel!

870
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,831
We both don't fit in here!
Today even less than before.

871
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,595
Be honest, Maria! You
give them a reason!

872
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,195
Isn't it your fault, Maria?
- Your guests are always very friendly

873
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,391
and I am friendly, too!
That's self-evident!

874
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,559
And you do nothing to it!
- Every woman tries to appeal.

875
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,076
If I don't appeal to others,
I won't appeal to you as well!

876
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,398
But others are not important,
you are! And you know that!

877
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,513
I know nothing! Everything
seems to fade away!

878
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,832
That is why I'm here! That is
why I have waited for six years!

879
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,271
Six hard years! For you to
came back to me, to let you know

880
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,477
where you belong! But
you have to trust me!

881
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,199
Trust? Trust, trust!

882
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,797
I can't imagine that he is
from the police. Just typical!

883
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,476
A clever guy who wants to take a chance.

884
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,200
He wants to go in for a career.

885
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,199
But not with me!

886
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,149
He may come upstairs later and
have a look at our transmitter.

887
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,037
So what?

888
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,590
If he is in room 9, it's very easy.

889
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,637
Your turn, Max.

890
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,872
Wait a moment! Lipinsky!
- Yes?

891
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,799
Tell me about this concierge, how many
dollars are still in his possession?

892
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,674
Nothing. He must have given
them all to the Baroness.

893
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,433
How much?
- 60!

894
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,439
She gave me 35.
- Still 25 left.

895
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,552
Wiegler has them. I saw it.

896
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,754
Here is your false money. Get
rid of it. Now and until doomsday!

897
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,674
We will get the ones from
Wiegler, too. Come on!

898
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,157
Do you think he will be dangerous for us?
- He is way too stupid for that.

899
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,914
Listen to me! This is the transformer
and here is the final current.

900
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,519
Is it possible to short-circuit
the transmitter and the receiver?

901
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,433
No problem, all you
need is a piece of wire.

902
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,956
Without attracting attention?
- Yes! But why?

903
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,793
If Wiegler pushes the button,

904
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,476
the current will reach the headphone
which is not isolated enough.

905
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,399
Bad luck, right? A
kind of electric chair.

906
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,592
That's impossible, no way!
- Cordy, keep a close watch outside!

907
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,192
Of course it will work.
- I don't think so.

908
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,434
There was something similar
written in the newspapers.

909
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,711
It was about a man who was
wearing headphones in bed

910
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,872
when a lightning
stroke into the antenna.

911
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,236
That's it!
- But they will find him!

912
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,189
So what? Leutner built a transmitter
and he was very jealous about the waiter.

913
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,755
That's enough for every prosecutor.

914
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,752
Why do we keep on talking,
you won't give in anyway!

915
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,520
Always the same! Confidence, trust...
- You have had enough drinks!

916
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,438
Stop trying to keep
me in leading-strings!

917
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,274
Please, for Wiegler and for me.
- Withdraw this dismissal!

918
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,272
You seem to be very affected.

919
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,073
I gave him this job and I
feel responsible for him.

920
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,436
Always him, always for
him! Sounds strange to me.

921
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,319
Martin, don't carry things too far!

922
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,790
I can't stand that any more!
- Who told him about my transmitter?

923
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,917
You must have told him!

924
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,878
Do you really think that I would tell
him something he could use against you?

925
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,714
Talk to him, I'm begging you!

926
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,918
Ask him about his lies, about spying on
you, everything, but don't degrade yourself!

927
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,232
No! He has to leave! At
least, I am the boss here!

928
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,077
If this is your last word I will go,
too. Martin, I'm serious about that.

929
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,553
Really? Well.

930
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,350
It was bound to happen. I knew it.

931
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:11,436
Leave, if you want! I won't stop you!

932
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,716
Go!

933
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,395
How long will it take you to assemble it?
- Ten minutes at the most.

934
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,119
Not more?
- Take my word for it.

935
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,789
Miss Maria starts to lock
everything around midnight.

936
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,000
It takes her fifteen minutes. A quarter
past midnight everything is done.

937
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,278
Well, everything is
ready for Mr. Wiegler now.

938
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,036
11:39 p.m.

939
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,790
Well, although the champagne
is reported to be exhausted;

940
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,429
I managed to get some bottles.

941
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,320
That's great. Tell me, you seem

942
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,557
to be able to play the piano.

943
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,236
Of course I am. I used
to play in a bar. May I?

944
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,439
Folks, he can play the piano!

945
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,953
That's all we need!

946
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,873
I'm afraid I can't do it.

947
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,316
I won't allow you to call it a day now!

948
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,716
Your employment has just begun.

949
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,354
You are working for me now!

950
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,591
And we still have to do
some business together.

951
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,792
Mr. Leutner will be very angry, I think.

952
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,559
Really? I'll take care of it.

953
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,239
Make a suggestion, Mr. Consul.

954
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,871
What are you thinking
of? I'd like to know it.

955
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,118
Clarification is my currency.
- Oh, we are talking about currency?

956
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,232
Eh! And he is brutal as well.
That leaves nothing to be desired.

957
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,993
Tell me; are you able to
do a radio transmission?

958
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,870
I think so. I have worked for
the reconnaissance battalion.

959
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,639
So you are able to send
a Morse code as well?

960
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,951
I am pretty sure. Why
do you ask, Mr. Consul?

961
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,436
Just an idea. Maybe we could
kill two birds with one stone.

962
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,593
Listen to me; we are very
interested to convince you

963
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,838
that our transmissions
are really harmless.

964
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,957
Well?
- Would you please hurry up?

965
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,430
I'd like to sing now!
- We are ready soon.

966
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,637
We will leave tomorrow. Now we
are looking for a radio operator

967
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,400
to hold the fort here. And you have
nothing else to do at the moment, right?

968
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,951
That's a possibility, Mr. Consul.

969
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:45,393
You're right. Listen: I am waiting for a
new transmission at 00:15 after midnight.

970
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,598
Let's get upstairs.

971
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,710
Room 9?
- You know it. That's good.

972
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,236
I will explain our transmitter to you

973
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,716
and you can listen to our
news and decipher them.

974
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,355
Agreed, Mr. Consul!

975
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,433
He is invited and I am not. I'm
told to believe everything they say.

976
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,632
Well, ready to go?
- Yes, of course. Go on!

977
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,280
I am previously convicted
in the matter of love!

978
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,036
So be careful, very careful, young man.

979
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,559
Opportunity makes a
thief, as the saying goes.

980
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,430
That's why I don't get started with you!

981
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,112
Nevertheless I can't
conceal that my blood

982
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,234
is almost kleptomaniac.

983
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,637
If I like a heart I have to steal it.

984
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:51,839
Give me a period of probation tonight!

985
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,835
Ladies and Gentlemen, please be quiet.

986
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,838
Think of the other guests
and Mrs. Leutner, she is sick.

987
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,475
Wiegler, I need you
outside. It's urgent!

988
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,350
Miss Cordy, Mr. Consul!
- Mr. Wiegler, wait a moment!

989
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,957
Yes, please?
- Are we clear?

990
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,878
Of course.
- What are your terms?

991
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,875
To keep it short: You let me participate
in your Dollar-Business, won't you?

992
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,276
Gosh! You are really fast!

993
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,750
When it comes to make some money.
- What are you thinking of?

994
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,792
It depends on how many
people are already involved.

995
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,714
Six with you.
- 15 Percent!

996
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,592
Done! Well?
- A quarter past midnight, room 9. I will be there!

997
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,195
Well, Zühlkechen. I am really tired.

998
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,030
I knew it would work out.

999
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,714
You have to beat people
at their own game.

1000
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,311
His jealousy will make
Martin hide in room 9

1001
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,877
to catch his perceived rival in the act.

1002
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,478
And for the judge it's very easy.

1003
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,280
A crime of passion. And I
am the principal witness.

1004
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,392
C'est ca!
- One moment please!

1005
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,153
Listen to me!
- Yes?

1006
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,710
Have you been here all the time?
- Yes, why?

1007
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,952
Maybe Zühlke has heard everything?

1008
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,079
Heard what? Him? No, never.

1009
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,798
Martin, I fear for you.

1010
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,151
The guy who has been
here earlier, who was it?

1011
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,636
That's none of your business.
Why do you care about Pallant?

1012
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,951
Stop thinking about Maria.

1013
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,840
Mother, it's all over between us.

1014
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,232
No! That's impossible.

1015
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:24,195
I knew it before. Well...

1016
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,436
Is it because...
- She leaves tomorrow morning.

1017
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,399
For God's sake! No,
Martin, this cannot be!

1018
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,076
It's true!
- Martin, go and talk to her!

1019
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,871
Maybe, yes, maybe it's not
to late? Go, Martin! Go!

1020
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,197
Where is Miss Mertens?
- I suppose upstairs, in her room.

1021
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,150
Mr. Leutner, I have
to tell you something.

1022
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,112
Here you are! We were
looking for you everywhere.

1023
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,158
Come with us, we managed
to get some champagne.

1024
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,360
Well, no lip!

1025
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,759
There it his. Excuse me for
a moment. I'll be back soon!

1026
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,237
Miss Maria?
- Mr. Consul?

1027
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,676
May I talk to you in private?
- Of course!

1028
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,353
Miss Maria, I am sure
that you have noticed

1029
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,557
my feelings for you?

1030
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,996
And I think that you
look worried right now.

1031
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,073
You are right.
- And what will you do now?

1032
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,072
I leave, if you want to know the truth.

1033
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,199
Sorry to hear that. But of
course I can understand it.

1034
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,437
Mr. Leutner is nice but...

1035
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,597
What do you really want from me?

1036
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,639
Well, I'd like to make a suggestion.

1037
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,878
You are leaving, right?
Come with me then!

1038
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,752
What do you mean?
- Just as I said.

1039
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,912
You might imagine what kind of life

1040
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,077
I can offer you.

1041
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,954
Yes, I can really imagine.

1042
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:20,230
Well! I need a woman like you.
Clever, eloquent, representative.

1043
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,120
And you think of me like that?
You are wrong, I'm afraid.

1044
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,637
How could I turn my life upside
down from one day to another?

1045
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,872
You are wrong about me.
- Please excuse me.

1046
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,549
Have I been too tactless?

1047
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,719
Nice of you to admit that. I
like you much more that way.

1048
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,355
So you don't say "no" once and for all?

1049
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,556
And do you know the best
about us, Leutnerchen?

1050
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,951
We know that we are worthless!

1051
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:50,876
Yes, yes, you are surprised now! We
just don't admit it. What would that be!

1052
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,999
God only knows why all
men cling to us like that.

1053
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,119
Just because of that little bit of fun?
- Leave Leutner alone!

1054
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,199
Shut up! Make way! You
know nothing about that.

1055
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,312
Pour me a drink instead! Come on!

1056
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:07,471
What do you know about soul at all?
Cheers, Leutnerchen, have a drink!

1057
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,597
Do you have a soul?

1058
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,436
Yeah, tell me!

1059
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,514
Oh yes, I know. You've got so much soul
you can't even talk about it, right?

1060
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,316
Always thinking about the other one,
right? Well, I can understand that.

1061
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,671
You know what? Forget about her!

1062
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,991
Why should I? She did nothing bad to me!

1063
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,755
It's all because of me. I am sure!

1064
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,634
I am alwas afraid that she
might betray me with other men.

1065
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,673
"Might"!
- She wouldn't do it, she wouldn't do it!

1066
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,395
I feel sorry for you.
But you are stupid!

1067
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,110
I don't need any pity!
- No, not you, no pity!

1068
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,239
You know, what you need? Another woman!
- I don't want another woman!

1069
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,993
Tell him!
- Shut up!

1070
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,993
What? What is it? What?

1071
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:55,518
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

1072
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,030
Tell him!

1073
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,510
All right, if you promise
me to stay calm...

1074
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,599
I'm sure that it is not
important. But I have heard that

1075
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,275
Mr. Wiegler and Miss Maria talked
about a meeting at quarter past midnight

1076
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,831
in her room. I'm sure it's
all about making travel plans!

1077
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,429
I have to admit that I heard it, too.
- That's it!

1078
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,438
Forget about her!

1079
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,954
Martin, stop bothering!

1080
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,880
Go upstairs and get certainty.

1081
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,639
I am sure that we got it wrong.

1082
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,474
Stop looking like that! Please,
don't do anything stupid!

1083
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,075
Swear it, Martin!
- No funny business!

1084
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,837
If I'll catch him, I'll kill him!

1085
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,350
Be quiet! If somebody hears you!

1086
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,593
Here are the keys, Miss Maria.
Everything is in good condition.

1087
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,519
Can I help you with anything else?

1088
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,196
Thank you. I'll do the accounting
now and leave tomorrow morning.

1089
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:57,319
Miss Maria, I don't know what
you are going to do later...

1090
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,271
Why?

1091
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,712
Maybe you could keep an
eye on Consul Pallant?

1092
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,032
Why, what is it?
- The guys have something on their mind.

1093
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,319
I mean the masteries inside. And
it's nothing good, that's for sure.

1094
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,235
I don't know what exactly; I was
only able to hear a few things.

1095
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,353
Dear Zühlke, what do I have
to do with the guests anymore?

1096
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,040
It's not about the guests,
it's about Mr. Leutner.

1097
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,034
Well, you might have heard
what Mr. Quint said earlier?

1098
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,874
It's really hard for me to
leave tonight, Miss Maria.

1099
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,794
I won't see you again after that.

1100
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:41,197
Keep the keys. Good night, my
dear Zühlke and my best wishes.

1101
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,070
When you are gone, it won't be as
nice at the Turfhotel Leutner as now.

1102
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,711
Nobody is irreplacable.

1103
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,634
But you won't forget
it, Miss Maria, will you?

1104
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,951
Forget what?
- About Mr. Leutner.

1105
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,950
No, I won't forget anything about it.
- So I will leave now.

1106
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,320
I'll take the way from the garage,
understood? You take care of the corridor!

1107
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,077
That you are rational when you have to.

1108
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,311
Even if you have your
own idiosyncraisies.

1109
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,199
Stop drinking that much.

1110
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,795
We have to keep our thoughts
together for a while.

1111
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,115
Well? Say something!

1112
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,194
Mr. Consul? Excuse me!
- Oh, Miss Maria!

1113
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,240
Nice to see you. Miss Czoch
was about to go anyway.

1114
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,279
Be my guest for a little while.

1115
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,034
Good night! Sleep well!

1116
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,710
Don't be so damned polite!

1117
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,840
Have fun!

1118
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,311
Good night, Miss!

1119
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,394
It's a great pleasure for me that
you came to me in the end, Miss Maria.

1120
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,997
There is a reason. We have to talk.

1121
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,914
The things you have
said to me earlier...

1122
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,878
I can't get them out of my head.

1123
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,640
I knew it! I hoped so.

1124
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,952
So you give me another chance?
- Maybe.

1125
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,153
I am very happy, Maria.

1126
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,955
But you won't tell me
what you are about to do?

1127
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,911
I can't.
- So it's evil then!

1128
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:04,592
Yes, it's evil. But I have to know now.

1129
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,592
One way or the other!
- Martin! Martin!

1130
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,393
Occupied? I'll try again later!

1131
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,078
Mr. Leutner! With whom you need to talk?

1132
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,038
But it's late! The Count will be asleep,
I'm afraid. But I try, if you wait a moment!

1133
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,512
Dear Count, there is a
call for you! I put through!

1134
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,798
No, he is not asleep. Pardon?

1135
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,915
I am not as problematic
as you may think.

1136
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,918
I am not able to show
my feelings immediately.

1137
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,517
Do you know what I mean?

1138
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,756
Maria! Miss Mertens!
- Yes, I'm coming!

1139
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,432
I'll be back soon.

1140
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,913
Maria, have you talked to Martin again?

1141
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,719
There is nothing more to say.

1142
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,317
I understand. Earlier, I
said things to hurt you.

1143
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,717
Maybe I was wrong. Please forgive me!

1144
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,317
But Martin is in danger!

1145
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,352
He is doing something stupid!

1146
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,916
You must help him!
- Why me?

1147
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,151
You are the only one who can.

1148
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,235
Maria!

1149
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,673
All right, mother! Go to bed
now. Do you need anything?

1150
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,435
Good night!

1151
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,313
Mrs. Leutner went to bed. There
is nobody to disturb us now.

1152
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,916
If you only knew how
nice you are, Maria.

1153
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,960
With all of your new-found bravery.
- Still I feel very insecure.

1154
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,113
I want to help you! To live
an independent life, Maria!

1155
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,357
You are so wonderfully superior.

1156
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,434
Listen to me, life is only
enjoyable if it is a big adventure.

1157
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,160
And I would be glad to
show you that kind of life.

1158
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:33,274
Nice!
- By the way; you and Leutner? Is it over?

1159
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,753
Finally?
- Finally! At last!

1160
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,078
Would I be here if not?
- Maria!

1161
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,118
But Mr. Pallant, there is
so much time for us now.

1162
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,840
Come on!
- So you don't have much time for me?

1163
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,038
And I thought that you'd like me?

1164
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,919
What's going on?
- Oh, please excuse me

1165
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,437
if I got you wrong but I
thought that you were a real man!

1166
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,314
Like your waiter? You
think that he is a real man?

1167
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,278
Really, does he look like one?

1168
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,031
I thought that only Martin
could be so stupid and jealous.

1169
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,790
You should know that I have
a better taste! A waiter!

1170
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,519
What do you think of me?

1171
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,752
But a waiter can be very useful.

1172
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,277
It's always good to listen to them.
- Really?

1173
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,918
To hear what?
- Something about the interesting guests.

1174
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,391
About a certain Mr. Pallant for example.

1175
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,120
I was interested in you
long before I knew you.

1176
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,638
- Guess what, me too!

1177
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,154
This is Mrs. Leutner!

1178
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,830
For God's sake, she is gone!

1179
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,955
Well, do you still have no time for me?

1180
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,312
No. It's really stupid
but I have to go soon.

1181
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,279
Now? That's impossible.
You can't do that to me.

1182
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,598
But I have to!
- Why? Business at this time?

1183
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,479
That's impossible.

1184
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,276
You know exactly that I am waiting
for news. For my latest hints.

1185
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,960
Yes, our joint venture?
I provide you with a room

1186
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,597
and you receive the hints there. We have
already something in common, I think.

1187
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,156
How could I throw away
that? I come with you!

1188
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,192
Impossible!
- Do you have something to hide?

1189
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,034
Not like that but...
- Is it so exciting?

1190
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,794
Very!
- And you think it's too dangerous for me

1191
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,991
to take part?
- Maybe!

1192
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,919
That's all I wanted to know!

1193
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,720
You should really be more confident! I
have to be acquainted with the business.

1194
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,600
That is ridiculous!
- I see. My first request!

1195
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,956
That's not what I call a good start!

1196
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,720
We have to talk serious
now, Mr. Pallant!

1197
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,639
Because you don't answer to my jokes.

1198
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,798
See, finally you are getting serious!
- Yes, very serious!

1199
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,032
How much is my salary?

1200
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,391
It's performance-related. - And what
kind of performance are we talking about?

1201
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,473
We talk about that later,
my dear, don't be afraid.

1202
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,236
So I'm going to be your
dispatcher? With my own office?

1203
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,953
Tell me, are you so
crafty or do you pretend?

1204
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,959
I think I will have
to if I get this job.

1205
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,316
By the way: What kind of
things do we export? Catched!

1206
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,358
You can't catch me so easy! Not me!

1207
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,957
Wait!
- I thought that you had no time for me?

1208
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,032
Enough! At least for you!
What are you doing there?

1209
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,675
Lock the door! So we
cannot be interrupted!

1210
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,314
Give me the key!
- Come and get it!

1211
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,393
You are making fun of me!
- Me? Why?

1212
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,070
It's about time!

1213
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,073
Open that door!

1214
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,435
There he is.

1215
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,199
Now it will happen.

1216
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,757
Hello?

1217
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,831
Good evening, Cordy!
- There you are!

1218
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,072
Is this your room? On this floor?
- No, my room is upstairs, under the roof.

1219
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,755
So you are waiting here...
- Room 9, but there is still some time.

1220
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,315
Yes, some minutes, right? And then...

1221
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,477
What? What will happen here in room 9?

1222
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,356
Tell me!
- At quarter past midnight, right?

1223
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,120
What?
- Well, a transmission, you know that!

1224
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,910
Yes, so what? So what?
- Don't go inside or something will happen!

1225
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,316
But I will take care of you just like
your Maria takes care of my Consul!

1226
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,039
So nobody is alone, right?

1227
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,351
Stop beating about the bush!
Who are you waiting for?

1228
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,558
For you! Don't go inside!
Stay alive instead!

1229
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:19,479
There won't be any transmission
tonight! You will know when you are dead!

1230
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,519
There is Lipinsky!

1231
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,434
Leutner!
- Over there!

1232
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,239
That was meant for me!

1233
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,593
And you should be the murderer!

1234
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,920
But somebody takes care of
the real murderer downstairs!

1235
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,315
Maria?
- Yes!

1236
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,914
Run, Brosek, hurry!

1237
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,236
Over there! Pallant, Maria!

1238
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,676
Leutner!

1239
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:15,995
Are you mad?

1240
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,478
There is still no light
up on the first floor.

1241
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,954
Don't worry!

1242
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,796
Hands up!

1243
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,435
Take him away!

1244
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,989
Please come on, Miss!
- Stay calm!

1245
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,995
Please, detective superintendent!
The police presidency!

1246
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,596
Hello?

1247
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,479
Yes! You have already heard about that?

1248
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,313
Yes, yes, I am very satisfied.

1249
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,676
Sure, sure, we got the head
of the business as well.

1250
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,237
What? The whole mission? Wait a minute!

1251
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,398
Consul! Some regards from
your business-partners in

1252
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,354
Paris and Rotterdam!
You will see them soon!

1253
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,875
You!

1254
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,394
Martin!

1255
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,996
Thank God it all went out so glad!

1256
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,517
Well... may I introduce to you
detective superintendent Lorringk, Madame?

1257
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,080
Lord!

1258
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,309
I think dear Wiegler did a
pretty good job, didn't he?

1259
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,831
Yes, almost too good.
- I don't think I was a very good waiter.

1260
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,195
And what about the others?

1261
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,960
Everything is fine! We got
them, detective superintendent!

1262
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,715
Well! Madame!
- Good bye!

1263
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,278
Are you sure that you are ok?

1264
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,074
Mr. Leutner, I hope that you know by
now that Miss Maria did nothing wrong?

1265
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:39,080
And what about you?
- Me? Don't mind.

1266
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,673
But you will have to be careful now.

1267
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,036
I will return as a guest every night.

1268
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,152
What do you think
about that, Miss Maria?

1269
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,633
