00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,013
<i>Get up at 5:30, get ready for work.</i>

167

Start work at 8:00.</i>

168
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,104
We should be finished by 2:00.

169
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,440
And then, um, head out to the gyms.

170
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,821
[Bulger] Someone's living
the Mexican-American dream.

171
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:19,619
I don't know if you wanna call it that,
but let's say hard work pays off.

172
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,454
I mean, unfortunately,

173
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:25,458
I didn't realize I was a coach
until almost ten years ago, you know.

174
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,585
I wasted a lot of my time just...

175
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,964
doing nothing.
Just working, you know.

176
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,721
Twenty-six years of my life in this place.

177
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,727
<i>It is difficult to try to manage work
and the kids.</i>

178
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,856
Yeah, I have, like, 30, 40 that compete.

179
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,109
And to train 30, 40 kids, it's hard.

180
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,194
<i>It's hard.</i>

181
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:59,242
<i>And if I could do boxing 24/7,
I would do this 24/7.</i>

182
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,745
<i>But at this time,</i>

183
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,041
making $200 every two months,
three months, can't do it, can't do it.

184
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,376
<i>You know?</i>

185
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,424
<i>B-Hop, he's been getting better
and better and better.</i>

186
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,844
<i>And if B-Hop turns out
the way we think he's gonna turn out...</i>

187
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,179
<i>four years I think I'll be out.</i>

188
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,980
- Time to get to work.

[Colbert] <i>I won my last</i>

190
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,570
So I was like, "Yeah,

191
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,154

<i>I'm not pressing to go to the Olympics.</i>

194
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,622
When I first started, I always wanted
to be an Olympic coach.

195
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,332
Like, I want to be up there when...

196
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,043
At the Olympics, I want to be one of the
head coaches of the United States.

197
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,981
[Colbert] <i>I don't care about the Olympics.</i>
<i>I never...</i>

198
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,275
Like, that never was really my mindset,
to go to Olympics.

199
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,510
My mindset was always
to be world champion, to be rich,

200
00:11:58,593 --> 00:11:59,844
like Floyd Mayweather.

[Hopkins] <i>Boxing and gold medal</i>

208

209
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,208
[Bulger] <i>The Olympics used to be where USA</i>
<i>beat the crap out of the world,</i>

210

<i>where we proved we were the best boxers.</i>

211
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,008
Winning the gold medal,
nothing surpasses that.

212
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,760
There are people who can say,

213
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,564
"I was a world champion
professional boxer."

214
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:47,309
<i>But to be an Olympic gold medal winner,
very few people can say that.</i>

215
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,353

231

[Awesome] <i>I started boxing in about 2005.</i>

00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:58,805
he's the only male we've got
that has a shot at winning the Olympics.

325
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,222
Winning a medal at the Olympics.

326

<i>He's the guy.</i>

327
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,937
<i>And the problem is,
the rest of the world is way ahead of us.</i>

328
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:10,482
<i>You know, the rest of the world,
amateur boxers make a living boxing.</i>

329
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,566
<i>Ours don't.</i>

330
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,487
In 2016, you're gonna
see the true amateur

331
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,741
that we develop here in the United States

332
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,954
and we've done since
the early 1900s for the Olympics,

333
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,914
you're gonna see them
competing against pros.

334
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,876
<i>And so, that's gonna be
a big challenge for our athletes.</i>

335
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,856
[Mirko Wolf] <i>We have the impression...</i>

336
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,674
Everyone in the world,
we have the impression

337

that USA is the number one nation
in everything.

338
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,613
- You are, like, the big brother. Yeah.
- [Bulger] We have so many athletes.

339
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,015
Like, you take care of it.
Like, you... [chuckles]

- You just know what you're doing.
- Yeah.

341
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:49,480
And you come here, and you see
the level of competition, and it's like...

342
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:55,027
If you send those kids against Russia,
man, it's gonna be sad for you.

[Bulger] <i>At the Rio Summer Games,</i>

the Olympics and protest,</i>

347
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:15,256

until we get funding.</i>

351

- Thank you.

<i>Yeah, we won't get funding

353

[Bulger] <i>I grew up playing</i>

<i>we hadn't had an American

390
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,404
People always say, "Steve,
where are the great heavyweights?"

391
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:47,158
I said, "They're on the football gridiron,
or they're posting up in the paint."

392

- Because I can't--
- [Yordan] I know--

Now, that's what I'm trying to say.

461
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,173
So he want me to do more for him,

462
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,509
but he don't know
what he's not able to do.

463
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,137

[Marquis Pierce] <i>It's the first time</i>
<i>he's ever gonna go four rounds,</i>

641
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,894
<i>and I don't think he's ready
for this shit.</i>

642
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,940
He's not even fighting
for the same cause that I'm fighting for.

643
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,736
You wanna be famous
and some superstar athlete.

644
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,612
I'm fighting for my life.

645
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,531
I'm fighting to make sure
food get put on my fucking table and shit.

646
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,078
<i>As I'm standing there,
he's up in my face,</i>

647
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,388
<i>you know, trying to talk down to me.</i>

648
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,916
<i>He's like, "This is gonna be an easy win."
And "I'm not worried about nothing."</i>

649
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,795
<i>Dude, you're 18 years old, bro.
Your balls barely dropped, my man.</i>

650
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,091
[Awesome] <i>Professional boxing,</i>
<i>it's all about perception.</i>

651
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,843
This pro boxer's 25-0.

652
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:03,096
But if you look at the 25 fighters
he fought, they're literally nobodies.

653
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,265
They're guys with 1-7 records

654
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,101
<i>and guys who've never boxed before,
guys making their debut.</i>

655
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,644
<i>And they build someone's record</i>

656
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,022
<i>to make them look
like a great, undefeated boxer.</i>

657
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,606
[announcer] 122.6!

658
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,276
[Dunkin] <i>Yeah, undefeated is so important.</i>

659
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,113
In boxing, the second you lose,
everybody's off of you.

660
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,493
We've come to a world now
where winning is all that matters.

661
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,162
As long as there are fighters out there

662
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:32,375
who think that they need to have
an undefeated record to be relevant...

663
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,296
I think they're very misguided.

664
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,007
I contribute that to Mayweather.

665
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,550
That's the Mayweather effect,

666
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:44,554
thinking about business
and thinking about the fight second.

667
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,937
[Bulger] <i>After years of anticipation,</i>
<i>negotiation and hype,</i>

668
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,523
<i>here in Las Vegas
on the first Saturday of May,</i>

669
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,276
<i>Floyd "Money" Mayweather
remains undefeated.</i>

670
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,405
<i>Earning an estimated $300 million
in one night</i>

671
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,951
<i>as he defeats Manny Pacquiao
in the fight of the century.</i>

672
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,955
<i>But I'm across town
at a place I always dreamed of reaching.</i>

673
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,958
<i>The National Golden Gloves Championships.</i>

674
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,171
[Jim Beasley] <i>Golden Gloves,</i>
<i>which started clear back in the 1920s,</i>

675
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,006
and throughout the history,

676
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,550
most everybody has been
in the Golden Gloves.

677
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,971
And many of our successful champions
like Sugar Ray Leonard

678
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,848
or Evander Holyfield or Mike Tyson,

679
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:31,810
all those kind of people,
Oscar De La Hoya, you can name 'em all,

680
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,854
they were Golden Glove champs.

681
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:37,983
And so this is the beginning
for the next breed of champions.

682
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,735
[indistinct yelling]

683
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,739
- Dig down in there!
- [exclaims]

684
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,742
Aim to the body. Both sides, baby.

685
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,079
[Leonard]
<i>Winning the Golden Gloves was huge.</i>

686
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,414
But then you win
the National Golden Gloves?

687
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,042
[scoffs] Forget about it.
It was everything.

688
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,044
<i>Ask any boxer.</i>

689
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,213
[Bulger]
So what's the plan tonight, champ?

690
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:04,134
Packing up shoes, socks,
shorts, cup, shirt.

691
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,677
Headgear.

692
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,971
[inhales deeply]

693
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,598
Mouthpiece, check. Got all the stuff.

694
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,519
Tonight fighting a dude
from, uh, South Carolina, I believe.

695
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,106
Don't know who he is.
Uh, don't know what he looks like.

696
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,902
Uh, well,
I'm sure he's a really nice guy, so...

697
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,863
let's go break his dreams.

698
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,578
[Bulger] <i>The Golden Gloves</i>
<i>is one of the few things</i>

699
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,831
<i>that has stayed constant
in amateur boxing.</i>

700
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,001
<i>It has nothing to do with the Olympics,</i>

701
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,212
<i>but it is the most prestigious tournament
in the country.</i>

702
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,859
[Awesome] <i>Golden Glove National Tournament</i>
<i>gets you no ranking points.</i>

703
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,677
<i>It gets you no international competition.
Gets you nothing.</i>

704
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,512
<i>But there's... It holds weight.</i>

705
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:53,349
<i>It holds weight in the world with people.
They like Golden Glove champions.</i>

706
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,351
<i>This tournament, it's a big deal.</i>

707
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,604
<i>I'm gonna be takin' it very seriously.</i>

708
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,065
<i>I'm fighting every fight</i>

709
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,943
<i>like it's the gold medal fight
in the Olympics this week.</i>

710
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,361
[bell ringing]

711
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,656
[indistinct shouting]

712
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,582
- [man 1] Go, baby!
- [man 2] Go!

713
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,791
[talking indistinctly]

714
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,419
[man 1] Whoop his ass!

715
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,297
[man 2] There you go!

716
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,299
- [indistinct laughter]
- [bell ringing]

717
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,970
- [Bulger] Coach, how did he do?
- [John] Excellent.

718
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,555
Perfect first fight.

719
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,309
For all these other monsters,
I saw about seven monsters out there.

720
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,811
They are getting bigger
every goddamned year.

721
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:43,774
What happened to real heavyweights
like Joe Louis, 202 pounds,

722
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,696
Joe Frazier, 204,
and "Big" George Foreman, 220?

723
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,992
Ali, 217.

724
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:56,912
[announcer] We have a winner,
boxing out of the blue corner...

725
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,958
- [applause]
- Cam Awesome. Cam Awesome.

726
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,104
- [Bulger] Yo, Awesome.
- [Awesome] Yo, yo.

727
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,439
- [Bulger] How did that go?
- [Awesome] It went pretty well.

728
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,757
My plan was just to land some jabs,

729
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,011
every so often throw an overhand left
to land-- to get some respect.

730
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,638
I figured I can win the fight

731
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,182
with no real risk
of exchanging punches with him.

732
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,268
[woman] <i>Good job, Cam.</i>

733
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,371
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good job. Good job. Good job.

734
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,788
- Bye, guys.
- Thank you, young lady.

735
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,439
We'll see you at the craps table.

736
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:27,068
[Bulger] <i>One hundred and thirty-eight</i>
<i>people eliminated on day one.</i>

737
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,070
<i>But Cam F. Awesome advances,</i>

738
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,613
<i>needing three more victories</i>

739
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,824
<i>to earn his fourth
National Golden Gloves Championship.</i>

740
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,452
<i>And maybe even the Golden Boy award,</i>

741
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,789
<i>given to the best overall fighter
in the tournament.</i>

742
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,385
Weigh-ins.
I think I'm over 200 pounds.

743
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,770
[Bulger] <i>For years,</i>
<i>Cam F. Awesome has dominated</i>

744
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,148
<i>the amateur super heavyweight division.</i>

745
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,234
<i>But here in Vegas, he's got competition.</i>

746
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,488
<i>Darmani Rock, from North Philadelphia,
is 19 years old,</i>

747
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,491
<i>and he's also qualified
for the Olympic trials.</i>

748
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:20,163
<i>At 260 pounds,
people are talking about him</i>

749
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,498
<i>like he's the next great
American heavyweight champion.</i>

750
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,543
[indistinct chatter]

751
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,046
How's he doing?

752
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,672
He's got a nice little right uppercut.

753
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,174
Yeah, I'm moving to my right--

754
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,058
I mean, fuck this.
You gotta start to do more.

755
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,177
[Awesome] Yeah.

756
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,324
[John] <i>So, everybody thinks</i>
<i>they can beat Cam</i>

757
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:40,141
'cause he's a little awkward
and different...

758
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,625
- [Bulger] Right.
- And they don't see the traditional boxer.

759
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,687
So they think,
"Oh, boy, I can probably beat him."

760
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,149
<i>And then they find out
it ain't what it looks like.</i>

761
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:53,363
So, I think we're gonna...
I suspect it's gonna be fun.

762
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,240
[crowd cheering]

763
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:59,035
[announcer] Cam Awesome.

764
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,749
[Bulger] <i>Four days later, sure enough,</i>

765
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,294
<i>Cam and Darmani find themselves
in the championship battle</i>

766
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:11,672
<i>to determine who is the best
super heavyweight in the country.</i>

767
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:15,050
I don't... I don't get sucked into
all the hype of who I'm fighting.

768
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:17,095
<i>I haven't lost a single round
this tournament.</i>

769
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,388
I'm going for the Golden Boy.

770
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,534
[man] <i>It's a pretty unique opportunity</i>
<i>for both these young men.</i>

771
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,603
<i>When you have a multi-day tournament,
so much can happen.</i>

772
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,563
<i>You know, you can get an injury...</i>

773
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:28,981
<i>They could've met in a draw,</i>

774
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,745
and they could've met
in the preliminaries.

775
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:34,820
So, it's really great for the boxing fans,
it's great for the storyline,

776
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:38,449
<i>and it's only gonna
elevate their fight game.</i>

777
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,162

Then, fuck him.
Get in there and fight with him.

If he's not hurtin' you...

789

God, I never fuckin' get it.

803
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,632
I've fought... I've won
fuckin' 12 national championships

804
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,966
for this goddamn country,

805
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,969
and not once have they given me
fighter of the tournament.

806
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,532
Statistically, I'm supposed to get it
one out of every ten times.

807
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:07,765
I fuckin' won it 12.

808
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:11,602
This is my sixth time
in the Golden Glove finals...

809
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:16,816
and, uh, six times I fought
in the Golden Glove finals and uh...

810
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:17,942
[panting]

811
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,528
and I'm going 50-for-50.
That's disgusting.

812
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,780
Fuckin'...

813
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,808
[rap music playing]

814
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,530
- [man laughing]
- [Colbert] I already see it in my head.

815
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:07,908
First round, I'm just gonna
let him chase me.

816
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,494
Second round, B-Hop.

817
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,287
I'm gonna just start fuckin' him up,
taking it to him.

818
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,290
Every time I hit him, "Got him!"
I'ma tell him that. "Got him!"

819
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,542
[laughter]

820
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,979
I'm gonna be like, "Lil bitch."
I'm gonna be fuckin' him up.

821
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,844
And after the fight,
after I knock his ass out,

822
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,483
stomp him, or beat the shit out of him,
either one...

823
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,549
Mmm-hmm.

824
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,135
I'ma be like,
"Good shit, bro. I'm proud of you."

825
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,263
[laughs] So, you took that...

826
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,367
- Yeah, after--
- "Took that loss like a champ, bro."

827
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:32,975
After the fight, it's all love.

828
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,185
I ain't got no hate on him.
I don't hate him.

829
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,788
[Colbert] He just gotta get ass-whooped.

830
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,052
I don't know why he signed that contract
like a dickhead.

831
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,502
[barber] "Don't take it personal.
It's business, bruh. Sorry.

832
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:42,902
Hope you're a fan after."

833
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,505
- [barber] See you later.
- [Colbert] See you tomorrow.

834
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:46,113
Be good, man. Good luck, bro.

835
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,990
- You're leaving?
- See you tomorrow, man.

836
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,176
- [Colbert] I look good.
- [man 1] Yeah.

839
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:03,506
Greatest thing you can do
is get that diploma, okay?

840
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,552
I am. I'm trying to.
I'm not tryin', I'm gonna get it. But...

841
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,155
People keep stressing me about
school, school, school, school, school.

842
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,014
I'ma stop going.

843
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,766
- You're not gonna stop.
- Who? Me?

844
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,185
- I done stopped going before.
- Uh-huh.

845
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,688
I done stopped going before,
and then I just went back.

846
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,272
Don't do that. It'll just...

847
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,527
make you have to keep starting over.
Bang it out.

848
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,779
Soon I'ma get tired of it and not go back.

849
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,699
Just bang it out. Get rid of it.
You know what I mean?

850
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,366
And you'll never have to go back again.

851
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,368
- [chuckles]
- Never.

852
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:35,621
And then you'll start thinking
about college, right?

853
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:37,623
You can hear me?

854
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:38,999
- Right?
- Huh? Say that again?

855
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,085
Then you'll start thinking
about college, right?

856
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,795
- [laughing loudly]
- What?

857
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,673
College is easier than high school.

858
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,062
- [man] He's a fighter. Look at you.
- I'm ready, man.

859
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,300
I ain't even worried.
I just wanna get this shit over with.

869

[Colbert] <i>It feels good to be a pro now.</i>

I always knew that I was gonna be
something great in my life.

892

It's gonna sound crazy,
what I'm about to say,

898
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,475
but he reminds me of Floyd Mayweather.

899
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:47,604
He reminds me of Floyd.
A young Floyd Mayweather.

00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,274
[man] One, baby, one.

901

[Colbert] <i>In the beginning of your career,</i>

I didn't get over that hill yet.
I'm still standing on top of it.

I feel like I'm the man.

905
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,494
And when it's time
to really step things up,

906
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,955
that's what's gonna happen,
I'm gonna go over that hill,

907
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,957
and do what I gotta do,
climb the next mountain.

908
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,501
Four more years,
I'll be champion of the world.

909
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,586
And that's a promise.

910
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:13,630

[Quillin] And they say hard work...

917
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,944
- Hard work always beats talent--
- Yep.

918
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,155
Talent can only take you so far.

919
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,407
- What if you talented--
- Get that hard work in. Huh?

920
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,535
What if you talented and you...
hard-working?

921
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,819

939

<i>And do they still define a champion?</i>

940
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:37,422

942
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,427
<i>But then came the sanctioning bodies,</i>

943
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:46,014
<i>organizations that created
their own championship belts</i>

944
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:49,601
<i>and received sanctioning fees

00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,157
<i>And he's gonna get his belt back.</i>

967
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,720
[Peter Berg] <i>Peter Quillin had</i>
<i>a reputation of being</i>

968
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,956
<i>just one of the meanest men in the ring.</i>

969
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,876
Now he's on the cusp of real greatness

970
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,627
but he hasn't really hit it yet.

971
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,174
<i>And the only person that can change that,</i>

972
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:06,136
and the only person
that can fix that is Peter Quillin.

973
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,184
[Quillin] <i>I did some sprints</i>
<i>on the beach today.</i>

974
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,411
Ain't gonna hear no complaints
about that.

975
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,269
[Eric] I understand.

976
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,439
- But I'ma remind you of my rule.
- Okay.

977
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,149
[Eric] On sparring days, what do we do?

978
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,943
We put it all over here.

979
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,028
[Eric] So, we run afterwards.

980
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,154
Yeah, yeah, but--

981
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,548
- [Eric] Not before.
- I don't have the time.

982
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,592
- [Eric] No, I understand, but...
- So I have to work through it.

983
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,701
[Eric] I can't let you limp.
I need your leg, okay?

984
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,620
Last time that's what I was doing.

985
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,514
- [Eric] Yeah?
- Yeah. So, I'm okay doing that.

986
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:36,166
Just, like, you got to hit that wall
and this is when I do.

987
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,061
- I did eight rounds all day.
- Knock that motherfucker down.

988
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,962
- Today.
- [man] <i>Hiciste bien, hiciste bien.</i>

989
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,671
[Eric] Knock that motherfucker down.

990
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,136

991
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:55,269
[Leonard] <i>With one year of inactivity,</i>

992
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,855
<i>it's extremely difficult
being who you were...</i>

993
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:03,360
because you become civilized.

994
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,198
<i>It's hard to come back to work.</i>

995
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,367

997

It's war.

998
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,752
Damn.

999
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,089
I felt it.

1000
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:26,883
I think that was bad luck
letting y'all film today, motherfuckers.

1001
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,052
[Bulger] No, you did great.

1002
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,511
"I did great."
You hearing me?

1003
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:33,223
Look, I got a busted lip.
I feel... I don't feel good.

1004
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,538
[Bulger] You were tired already
when you came in.

1005
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:39,604
You had a long day, right?

1006
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:40,940
Yeah.

1007
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,692
I mean, every other day was a long day.

1008
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:04,838
[announcer] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>stepping to the scales,</i>

1009
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,342
Peter "Kid Chocolate" Quillin.

1010
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,802
One-sixty-one-point-four,

1011
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:16,642
161.4 pounds
for Peter "Kid Chocolate" Quillin.

1012
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:21,730
Peter Quillin will have two hours
to lose 1.4 pounds.

1013
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,525
There's a title fight tomorrow night,
trying to get to a weight of 160.

1014
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:30,197
The kids I had used to
take 10 to 12 pounds off in two days.

1015
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,242
<i>What the fuck is two pounds?
What are we talking about?</i>

1016
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,828
[Malignaggi]
<i>I think when you accept the fight,</i>

1017
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,122
<i>you have to make the weight.</i>

1018
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,349
You get a little bit civilized

1019
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,833
as you sit back on your money
and enjoy life,

1020
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,037
and, suddenly, the months pass
and you haven't fought.

1021
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,505
<i>But if a belt was that important,</i>

1022
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,466
<i>you probably would've made the weight
no matter how much you suffered.</i>

1023
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,052
[Bulger]
<i>It's one of boxing's craziest rituals.</i>

1024
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:55,514
<i>Fighters virtually starve themselves
and sweat out pounds</i>

1025
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:58,225
<i>to make weight the day before a fight.</i>

1026
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,936
<i>Kid Chocolate gets down to 160.5 pounds,</i>

1027
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:06,900
<i>failing to make the 160-pound
middleweight limit.</i>

1028
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,652
According to any of the belt rules,

1029
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,488
you have to make weight
in order to fight for the belt.

1030
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:15,450
You can't be one ounce,
one quarter of an ounce over.

1031
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,286
You have to on weight or under.

1032
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:20,705
So, this fight now went
from being a title fight

1033
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,208
to being a non-title bout.

1034
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:27,171
They don't take
the Super Bowl trophy as a joke.

1035
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:31,216
They don't take the NBA trophy
at the end of the championship as a joke.

1036
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,761
<i>Like Quillin did,
you live and die with those decisions.</i>

1037
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,182
[Quillin] <i>I mean, I'm 31-0.</i>

1038
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:41,310
That record got me to that title.

1039
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:44,313
It got me to the title.
You know what I'm saying?

1040
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,856
And then, for me to...

1041
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,318
not lose sight of that,

1042
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,736
lets me know
that I appreciate the work I did.

1043
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,656
I mean, trying less than your best
is never good enough.

1044
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,909
I will feel bad about myself
if I didn't give it my all,

1045
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,119
but I know I gave it my all.

<i>the full 12-round distance,</i>

1070
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,219
<i>the outcome is determined by three judges.</i>

1071
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,680
<i>The advantage
to knocking out your opponent</i>

1072
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,475
<i>is that you keep it out of their hands.</i>

1073
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,977
<i>They all see it from a different angle.</i>

1074
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,523
[announcer] Your third
and final judge at ringside

1075
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:37,736
scores the fight 113-113.

1076
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,446
- He has it even.
- [crowd roaring]

1077

- [man] What happened?
- [Brad Bose] That's no draw.

1079

No draw there, I'll tell you that.

1080
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:51,833
[man] Kiss his ass.

1081
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,918
[Bose] This is the problem with boxing,
right here.

1082
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,022
[Watson] <i>Kid Chocolate beat him</i>
<i>fair and square.</i>

1083
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,674
<i>Knocked him down three times.

1084
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:02,511
But... the white boy was strong.
He was tough.

1085
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:05,096
Andy Lee's a tough guy.
He's a great fighter.

1086
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:08,892
[Quillin] <i>This was just a chess match.</i>

1087
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,560
<i>This wasn't checkers. This was chess.</i>

1088
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,020
You know, with the year off,

1089
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:15,440
I never like to look for excuses
for why I did bad.

1090
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,817
I like to look for excuses
why I should do better.

1091
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:21,655
And this is just part of my chapter
that I'ma always remember.

[indistinct chatter]

1093

[Awesome] <i>When I lose a fight,</i>

1094
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:39,506

1095
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,300
<i>I just really like winning.</i>

1096
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:44,761
[Bulger] I mean, you can't win
everything, though. You know?

1097
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:49,057
Mmm... You can't win everything is...
I feel like that's a cop-out.

1098
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,892
'Cause if you can't win everything...

1099
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,353
Actually, technically,
you can win everything.

1100
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,272
It's hard to win everything.

1101
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,775
And you have to strive for perfection,
and perfection is almost impossible.

1102
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,945
But I think saying,
"You can't win everything,"

1103
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,698
is just a cop-out for losing sometimes.

1104
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:17,336
[trainer] Yep, yep, don't give up.
No, no, no. Five more. Max it up.

01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:54,117
he will be a champion.

1150
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,440
He could be a great champion, too.
One of the elite ones.

1151
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,206
- How'd you get there?
- Took a cab.

1152
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,667

feed your family.

1156
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:13,845
And how you gotta handle your money.
It's like a business.

1157
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,680
Why do you need $200?

1158
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,140
- [Colbert] I need it.
- For?

1159
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,017
I gotta get something.

1160
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,477
What? Stupidity?

1161
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,479
No, I gotta get some sneakers
for somebody.

1162
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,248
- Oh, get the hell outta here.
- Not for me.

1163
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:26,733
I have to buy these sneakers, though.

1164
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,443
- I ain't giving it to you.
- They're like $50, though.

1165
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,680
I thought you needed it for the ID.

1166
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:35,074
Yeah, the ID, too. The ID's not that much.

1167
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,744
The most is gonna be, like, $50
for the cab and the ID.

1168
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,245
So, I'm only giving you $100.

1169
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,039
- What?
- I'm only giving you $100 then.

1170
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,542
No, no, no. $200.

1171
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,963
Then the extra $50
is gonna last me for the week.

1172
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:51,132
Still need a ride?

1173
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,510
- It's $1,000, right? It's $1,000 left.
- Mmm-hmm.

1174
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:54,594
$1,500--

1175
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,263
[chuckles]
Nobody makes money overnight. It's...

1176
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,016
Nobody. Nobody has done it,
made money...

1177
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,768
It takes... it takes years.

1178
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:07,315
You build up a record and get well-known
and stay out of trouble.

1179
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,073
[Colbert] All aboard!

This not my camp.

[Bulger] So you're not really

1199
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,759
No. It's sparring.

1200

That's it.

1201
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,302
[Bulger] Right.

This ain't vacation, boy.

1204

- This ain't no vacation.
- I don't give a fuck about no sparring.

1206
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,461
- I don't give a fuck about this, nigga.
- Yeah, right.

1207
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,963
I could be on vacation and still go spar.

1208
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:38,990
I'll go on vacation, a real vacation,
and still go to the gym.

1209

And he's the world champ and he's making
a decent penny on his next fight.

No, it isn't. You changed it.

1338

Oh, I did change it,
but I took the legal procedures.

1339

It's on my passport,
credit card, my license.

1340

without receiving a punch,</i>

[Bulger] So, was this all worth it?

1358
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:29,520
It was definitely all worth it,
but all today is...

1359
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:34,525
is just basically me

1360
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,820
getting back to where I left off.

1361
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:18,194

You can't just go up there and make music
and think it's good enough.

1380
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:21,089
You have to always go
the extra length to want it.

1381
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:25,218
Like, I was willing to sleep on,
fucking, a mattress I found in the trash

1382
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:27,971
to make my success work for me.
You know what I'm saying?

1383
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:30,724
Wasn't about girls,
wasn't about nothing else in life.

You know what I'm saying?

1385
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:34,037
So, in life, you have to figure out
what you're motivated over.

1386
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,330
- [Bulger] When you realize your situation.
- Yeah.

1387
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,154
You realize where you're at
and your situation

1388
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,542
and how you're gonna get up out of it.

1389
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:41,652
'Cause you notice that
you be in a pool full of crabs

01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,904
and you don't know
why you keep getting pulled in,

1391
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:46,824
it's because you have no plan to get out.
You know what I'm saying?

1392
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:49,828
And then eventually, you'd be, like, 35,
and you're like, "What happened?"

1393
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:53,831
And you was so much in the fucking moment
all the time that you...

1394

01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:19,828
and you see someone that's
doing something of the sweet science...

1445
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:23,499
They hit and not get hit,
they take away and disarm a guy,

1446
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:27,335
and make him look...
Reduce him down from a killer to nobody.

1447
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,337
From a beast to nobody.

1448
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:33,592
How did you do that...
in that squared circle?

1449
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:44,645
Hey, man.

1450
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,980
[Quillin] This fight was meant to happen.

1451
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,608
No matter what I could have did wrong,

1452
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:51,068
what I could have did right.

1453
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,445
It was all supposed to happen
the way that it did.

1454
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:54,988
[man] Yeah.

1455
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:57,282
It's all part of your story now.

1456
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:00,469
Walk out of here
with a smile on your face.

1457
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:02,245
[man mutters indistinctly]

1458
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:08,376
[De La Hoya] <i>I believe</i>
<i>that if a fighter goes in there</i>

1459
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,795
<i>and fights his heart out,</i>

1460
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,339
<i>and just leaves everything in the ring,</i>

1461
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:15,968
<i>he's gonna live to see another day.
He's gonna live to see another fight.</i>

1462
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:20,222
People are gonna wanna see him again,
regardless if you lose or win.

1463
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,100
[Bulger] Being undefeated, does it matter?

1464
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,728
It doesn't matter.
It happened the way it happened.

1465
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,915
Somebody asked me,
"Are you scared to get in the ring?"

1466
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:32,525
I said, "I'm not scared to fight,
I'm not even scared to lay down.

1467
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:33,902
The only thing I'm scared of

1468
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:36,529
is to see how many people
that's here for me right now,

1469
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:39,491
in this moment, after I lost, disappear."

1470
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:43,912
<i>The only thing I could do
is go back to the gym,</i>

1471
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:48,500
<i>reassess myself with my team
and try our best in the next go round.</i>

1472
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:54,089
[engine starts]

1473
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:03,348
[Bulger]
<i>Two years in the life of American boxing</i>

1474
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,769
<i>will teach you a lot about
the sport's issues and problems...</i>

1475
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:11,314
<i>but mostly about its champions.</i>

1476
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:16,945
<i>Boxing has never been a perfect sport
and it never will be.</i>

1477
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:21,116
<i>But it is about people
who can rise to the best of themselves</i>

1478
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:22,660
<i>when they put on the gloves.</i>

1479
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,369
[indistinct announcement]

1480
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,539
<i>Like my mom always said,</i>

1481
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,876
<i>it's not about how many times
you've been knocked down.</i>

1482
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,753
<i>It's how fast you get up.</i>

1483
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,923
<i>Boxing is about kids like me,</i>

1484
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:40,343
<i>who, wherever they're from, need
something only this sport can provide.</i>

1485
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:46,099
<i>Whether it's direction, or discipline,
or glory and fame and fortune.</i>

1486
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:51,021
<i>A champion is someone who,
despite tremendous odds,</i>

1487
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,481
<i>in a brutal, corrupt pursuit,</i>

1488
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:58,236
<i>proves that the impossible,
what most of us might never dare,</i>

1489
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,780
<i>could actually happen.</i>

1490
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:05,285
<i>These dreams are still born every day
in gyms like Atlas Cops and Kids.</i>

1491
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:10,207
<i>And as long as there are kids who need
to fight their way out of somewhere...</i>

1492
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,752
<i>that squared circle will be calling.</i>

1493
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:15,879
[cheering] Hey, hey, hey!

1494
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:21,384
<i>The strategy remains the same, in this,
the most elemental of martial arts:</i>

1495
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:23,887
<i>hit and don't be hit.</i>

1496
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:29,226
[announcer] And still undefeated,
Chris "Lil B-Hop" Colbert!

1497
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:31,311
- [crowd cheering]
- [man] Let's go! Let's go!

1498
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:32,813
[bell rings]

1499
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,654
Who's that?

1500
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:24,865
Who is that?

1501
