1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,560
Do you have to do that right now?

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,720
Well, if you want to eat at 1pm, yes.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,520
I'm going to do the crossword puzzle.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
- Hey, mum.
- Alright, my teddy bear?

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,800
Did you sleep well?

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,640
So, you roll battered chicken in it.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,120
I know, flour!

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
1 point for Odile.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,960
Old-fashioned?

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,640
- Old.
- Decrepit?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,360
- No, 8 letters.
- Outdated.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,360
Ridiculous.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,440
Obsolete.
You guys are rubbish!

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,520
I'm going for a swim.
Anyone coming?

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,680
No, thanks!

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,440
I really don't know why I ask.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,680
It's going to rain!

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,080
So?

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,520
You're doing it on purpose.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,360
- You like chicken!
- I'm eating.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,920
I'll go on, "Unbearable".

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,520
Odile.

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,360
Ha! That fits!

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,000
Of course that would fit!

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,400
It's made just for you!

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,960
Life turned upside down

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,680
Lunch is ready!

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,680
Can you give that to me? Thanks.

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,680
Where's Mum?

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,960
Mum!

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,400
Mum, lunch!

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
Did you see her come back
from the beach?

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,240
No, she didn't come back.

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,800
Has no one seen her
since this morning?

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,160
People saw her go into the water,
but not come back out.

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,240
Is that not her dressing gown there?

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,680
Shit, we have to call for help!

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,120
Yes, a blond woman, thin,
in a black swim suit.

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,440
She was wearing
a flowery red swim cap.

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,280
And a red flowery swim cap.

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,960
Right, I'll tell the family.

42
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,280
Thanks.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,600
They found her on Antifer beach.

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,960
She's fine, don't worry.
She's in the hospital in Le Havre.

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,120
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,080
Yes, OK.

47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,520
No, I'll call you back.

48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,240
Stéphane sends his love.

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,240
Hello.
Are you Mrs Ardant's daughters?

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,160
Yes.

51
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,960
She is tired but well.
She can leave now.

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,960
Did she tell you what happened?

53
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,360
The current was strong,
she got tired and disorientated.

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,480
That's weird, she knows
the coast by heart.

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,560
She has swum there for 40 years.

56
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,880
Maybe she was faint
or had hypoglycaemia.

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,440
That's it, she ate
almost nothing today.

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,480
- Doctor!
- Yes.

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,000
- Can you come?
- Yes.

60
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,240
You should get her checked out.

61
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,520
Can you make
an appointment with her GP?

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
- Thanks a lot.
- Good bye, doctor.

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
It's still strange.

64
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,040
The main thing is we found her.

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,840
How are you feeling, Mum?

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm fine.

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm a bit tired, that's all.

68
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,280
That's normal.

69
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,760
What an adventure!

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
- Were you scared?
- Well, yes!

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,400
Really!

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,480
My hair must look awful.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,760
No, you look fine.

74
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,040
You're beautiful.

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,400
Let's go home then.

76
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,600
Let's go!

77
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,320
I can't stand hospitals.

78
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,400
And you didn't know where you were?

79
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,520
I wonder if my name
has affected my life.

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,920
Sorry?

81
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,120
I was wondering whether
my name has affected my life,

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
my person, my personality.

83
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,160
Claire,

84
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,680
from "clear",
like something transparent,

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,600
something not seen or looked at.

86
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,400
Since I was little, I've felt clear.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,600
In fact, when my husband
asked me to marry him,

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
I took time to believe it.

89
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,000
When he left me,
I found it all rather expected.

90
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,200
I'm the only one like that
in my family.

91
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,600
Perhaps it's because
I'm the middle child.

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,440
What time shall we meet this evening?

93
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,640
I can't this evening,
my in laws are coming for dinner.

94
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,440
I just found out, I'm sorry.

95
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,160
But if you want, I'll try
to get free tomorrow.

96
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,600
- OK.
- Alright?

97
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,600
Bye.

98
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,680
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

99
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,840
Mum just wrote a cheque
of 30,000 euros to Mélenchon.

100
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,160
30,000 euros!

101
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,760
Yes, to Mélenchon.

102
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,080
To the left front,
can you believe it?

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,320
No, the cheque bounced.

104
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,440
You know that
she doesn't have 30,000 euros.

105
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,000
I called her,
but god knows what she's doing,

106
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,960
her telephone just keeps ringing.

107
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,760
I didn't write this.

108
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
Mum, it's your signature.

109
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,560
Perhaps it's my signature,
but I didn't write it!

110
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,560
Don't you think I would remember?

111
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,840
So who did it then?

112
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,400
Can I have some water?

113
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,360
You three accusing me like this
is making me angry.

114
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,280
Can you get a glass, please, Claire?

115
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,720
We're not accusing you,
but if you didn't write it, who did?

116
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,640
- Where's your cheque book?
- I don't know.

117
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,720
In any case,
it couldn't have been me!

118
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,520
I hate politics

119
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,480
and I don't even know the guy.

120
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,760
- Mélenchon?
- No, I don't want melons.

121
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,080
Mélenchon! He's a revolutionary.
He's on the TV,

122
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,520
brown hair and angry. He wants
to send everyone to gulags.

123
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,880
He's different.

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
You like him like every other idiot.

125
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,720
Well, he's better than the BNP!

126
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,320
- Because I like the BNP!
- I do wonder.

127
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,720
Go and fight elsewhere.
I can't do this anymore, I'm tired.

128
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,400
How did they contact you?

129
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
Did they come here or call?

130
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,480
Stop this now!

131
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,880
You're pissing me off!

132
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,880
Can't I do what I want with my money?
That's what you mean, say it!

133
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,840
Calm down.

134
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,800
Well, can you come
into the kitchen now, please?

135
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,000
Warden
Please ring

136
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,240
Hello, Mrs Perreira.
Please, excuse our interruption.

137
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,680
We were wondering if you're still
cleaning our mother's flat.

138
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,040
Oh no!
She doesn't want me over anymore.

139
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,880
Really? Since when?

140
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
For about a month.

141
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,840
She wasn't paying me anymore either.

142
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,440
She's been muddled with her cheques.

143
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,760
- How much does she owe you?
- 430 euros.

144
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,800
If you don't mind me saying,
she's got a little problem.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,760
Sorry?

146
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
She has said odd things
to others in the building.

147
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,920
What things?

148
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Sexual things!

149
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,760
Two days ago, she spoke to
Mrs Lelievre about "broche"!

150
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,920
About what?

151
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,880
About fellatio.

152
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
About fellation.

153
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,240
She said she likes it and
that it was important to do

154
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,560
and that she has done it a lot.

155
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,720
Can you finish writing the cheque?

156
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,680
It was our mother who spoke to
Mrs Lelievre about fellation,

157
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
is that right?

158
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,640
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

159
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,920
- Good bye.
- Thanks, Mrs Perreira.

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Well I never!

161
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
I can't stand that woman,

162
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,240
she's always lurking on the stairs
and talking shit.

163
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,360
She can't have made
that fellation stuff up!

164
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
Can you imagine Mum talking
about fellation to that lady?

165
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,920
- She doesn't know what it is!
- Apparently she loves it.

166
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,200
That's enough, Claire.

167
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,400
Fellation aside, Mum has a problem.

168
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,960
She's getting old.

169
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,600
She's not getting old, Odile,
she's losing it.

170
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,200
What are you saying?

171
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,880
She's not the same
and it didn't start today.

172
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,040
It was already happening
this summer in Etretat.

173
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,080
I think she's finding it hard
to remember words

174
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,120
and she speaks to us
more often in German, right?

175
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,920
- No.
- Yes, she does!

176
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,640
- Perhaps it's depression.
- You don't get depression at 68!

177
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,800
Of course it happens.

178
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,000
I can ask about that.

179
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,320
She's better off seeing a specialist.

180
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,040
Who do you want to go see?

181
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,360
I don't know anybody.

182
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
Vincent's cousin
is a prof of neurology.

183
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,840
I can ask him to make
an appointment for us.

184
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,240
I've got to go.

185
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,560
- Do you want it?
- No.

186
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,880
What are you doing with the rubbish?

187
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
I don't know.

188
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,640
She has messed up
with money before.

189
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,960
This summer,

190
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,040
she gave me 500 euros and said:

191
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,160
"Here's 500 francs, darling,
but share it with your sister."

192
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,680
You gave the money back, I hope.

193
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,840
That's really dishonest, Guillaume!

194
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,000
What happens if your aunts find out?

195
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,800
Don't worry.

196
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,400
Don't ever do that again!

197
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,680
Is that understood?

198
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,360
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

199
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,760
Did you get my messages?

200
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,200
Yes, but it's been non stop
this morning. What's going on?

201
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,080
I need an appointment with
your neurologist cousin.

202
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,880
My mother has a problem.

203
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,480
Oh shit!

204
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,640
- What age is she?
- 68 years old.

205
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,040
Listen,

206
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,240
I think Francois is very good,

207
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,800
but the problem is,
he's not my cousin,

208
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
he's my wife's cousin.

209
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,880
Can't you just
recommend me to him?

210
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,240
That bothers me because of my wife.
Do you understand?

211
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,920
Give me his details
and I won't mention you.

212
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,920
You won't get an appointment
before 6 months,

213
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
he's hard-pressed.

214
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,920
You know what hospitals
are like these days.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,520
I don't have his number.

216
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,680
I'll call you with it.

217
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,680
I'll find someone else,
it'll be easier.

218
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,920
If you want to.

219
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,800
Another coffee?

220
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,600
Yes, I'll take care of it.

221
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,960
OK, bye.

222
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,320
So, Julie's neurologist
is not going to work out.

223
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,760
Her boyfriend was supposed
to get us an appointment.

224
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,560
You can find someone else.

225
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes, I will find someone else.

226
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
It's always the same

227
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,360
because I'm the one
who doesn't work.

228
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,400
Tell your sisters if it bothers you.

229
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,680
No, it doesn't bother me.

230
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
Now the kids have gone,
I've got time.

231
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,560
Call Cyril Ferney, his mother
had the same problem.

232
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,600
They ended up putting her in a home.

233
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,080
Father Kaplan has gone gaga too.

234
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,280
He wanted to celebrate
Christmas the 14th of July.

235
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,360
That's horrible.

236
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,120
It seems like there's
more and more of them.

237
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,480
We're just at the age where
our parents are getting ill.

238
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
It'll be our turn next.

239
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,120
Yeah, already!

240
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,320
Should we eat out tonight?
It'll be good for you.

241
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,960
I'm not in the mood for that.
I've got to solve this first.

242
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,120
Till tonight.

243
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,240
- It's still not over?
- They're doing tests.

244
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,520
What tests?

245
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,760
I have no idea.

246
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,400
Tests.

247
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
- How did it go?
- Very well.

248
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,240
I don't know what I'm doing here.

249
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,120
I just need her 5 mins more.

250
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,840
We're going to take some blood.

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,880
Alright?

252
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I'm not deaf.

253
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,560
- So?
- That's it.

254
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,560
- What's it?
- Alzheimer's, Claire.

255
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,000
It's not chicken pox.

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,960
She said that it was 2040,
that she only has 2 girls

257
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,000
and that David Pujadas
hits on her during the news.

258
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,240
Which one of us did she forget?

259
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,520
It must have been me.

260
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,440
Oh, and by the way,
Dad is no longer dead.

261
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,800
Well, at least there's
some good news.

262
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,520
Did you understand
what was said, Mum?

263
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,120
You'll need to take
some medication.

264
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,520
Every day, it's very important.

265
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,080
But I don't need medication!

266
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,760
I'm fine.

267
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,360
I'm just a bit tired, that's all.

268
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,240
It's no big deal.

269
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,680
We'll see when you're my age.

270
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,520
We need to find someone
to help you at the house.

271
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,040
You can't stay alone.

272
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,840
No, I don't want anyone at mine.

273
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,880
She's annoying!

274
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,280
It won't be Mrs Perreira,
we'll find someone else.

275
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,000
I want to be left alone,
I don't want anyone at mine.

276
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,280
It'll be someone nice and discreet.

277
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Alright.

278
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,400
But I don't want anyone coming.
I don't want anyone at my house.

279
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,960
Don't you want those?

280
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,360
Thanks.

281
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,120
Can you do an internet search
for home helpers, please?

282
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,120
Choose a few people,
but only those with references.

283
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
Thanks.

284
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:36,720
Hello?

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,800
Ah yes, yes, that's right.

286
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,320
What's your name?

287
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,640
Di...

288
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,120
Oh! Diallo, OK.

289
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,280
Do you have references?

290
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,600
References.

291
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,160
No, references.

292
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,400
Letters that show you've already
done this type of work.

293
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,880
Sorry, but this won't work,

294
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,080
I'm looking for someone
who speaks some French.

295
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Hello?

296
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,680
She hung up on me.

297
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,680
That's nice!

298
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,080
Yes, yes. Hello?

299
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
Yes, that's right, yes.

300
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,160
Can you speak French? Good.

301
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,680
Reliable person needed
for elderly confused person.

302
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,640
References required.

303
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,440
Hello.

304
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,600
That's 40% off.

305
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
"Confused",
does that mean she's crazy?

306
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,320
I think it's Alzheimer's.

307
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,000
Does it pay well?

308
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,800
I don't know.

309
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,600
The family has found someone.

310
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,240
So I'll put this away.

311
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,520
It must be horrible,
looking after old folk.

312
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,480
Feeding them, changing
their nappies and all.

313
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,960
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

314
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,520
Well, good bye.

315
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
This isn't great.

316
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,280
Do you like it, Nina?

317
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,280
It's not bad.

318
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Not her.

319
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,640
Not her either.

320
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,440
Is there only sardines?

321
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,480
There's 34 tins left,
we can't throw them away.

322
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,920
So, there's about 3
that look alright.

323
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,440
Odile's one,

324
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,760
my one and Claire's little one.

325
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,240
Did you check her out?

326
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,120
No, her reference left the country.

327
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,080
She's lying, she has no references.

328
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,200
Why say that?
She looks honest.

329
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,720
My one has brilliant references.

330
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,880
Your one wants to declare
3,000 euros a month.

331
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,720
That's twice what I earn!

332
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,640
You do the job.
Where's your CV?

333
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,080
They have to declare it all.
What if they dob on us?

334
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,320
Well, if they declare the salary,
then we pay double.

335
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,240
Perhaps you can pay a bit more,
but not Claire and I.

336
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,160
- I can't at all.
- Me neither!

337
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,800
The kids' studies aren't free!

338
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,840
So we can't declare it all.

339
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Some of it, yes, but not all of it.

340
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
What about Dad's life insurance?

341
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,480
No, Mum wants to keep it for Etretat.

342
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,040
The roof needs redone
and the boiler is on its way out.

343
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,800
How much does yours want?

344
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,920
Well...

345
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
2,000 euros but it's negotiable.

346
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,440
She wants to declare as little as
possible to keep her benefits.

347
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,920
She's taking advantage!

348
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,720
For once it's helping us out.

349
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,120
What's her name?

350
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,320
Corinne Berthier.

351
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,040
50 years old,

352
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,120
she seems responsible.

353
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,160
We'll have to introduce her to mum.
If she doesn't like her...

354
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,760
It's nice of Guillaume to stay
the night here from time to time.

355
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,720
What bothers me is that mum
tried to kiss him on the mouth.

356
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,800
She was convinced that he was dad.

357
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,120
Are you worried
he'll lose his virginity?

358
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,720
After the whole fellation incident,
I'm just concerned.

359
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,240
I'd like to pass my driving test.

360
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,680
I'd like my own car and to go
where I like, when I like,

361
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,160
no need to depend on anyone.
Do you get me?

362
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,040
Yes, I do. It's called autonomy.

363
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,480
That's what I want
my psychiatrist to look at.

364
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,400
- Is it working out?
- I don't know, she never talks.

365
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,760
It must be part of the therapy.

366
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,280
Why don't you learn to drive?

367
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,880
It's hard enough for the youngsters
so imagine old me.

368
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,160
Stop putting yourself
down all the time!

369
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,840
You're not more stubborn
or more incapable than others.

370
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,520
You're uglier though!

371
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,760
But that never stopped
anyone from driving.

372
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,720
Do you want to come up?

373
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,160
Vincent's waiting.

374
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,040
I know what you think.

375
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm stupid, I'm worth more
and he'll never leave his wife.

376
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,960
Well, I'm the right person to know
that a husband can leave his wife.

377
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,160
Right, I'm off.

378
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,240
Can you look at me walking
to see if I'm thinner?

379
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,280
I've totally stopped eating cake.

380
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,480
OK.

381
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,720
Vincent!

382
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,480
I can't stay,
my daughter's in hospital.

383
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,040
Shit! What's wrong?

384
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,200
Peritonitis.
They're operating now.

385
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,160
Do you want me to take you?

386
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Yes, I'd like that.

387
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Thanks.

388
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,560
"Little jug."

389
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,320
7 letters.

390
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,640
I've no idea.

391
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,920
Pitcher!

392
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,840
You know it's very good for the...

393
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,560
She's late.

394
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,880
I hope the negotiations
weren't too much.

395
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,920
Ah! The phone.

396
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,920
Tell me something about yourself.

397
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,480
What do you like to do?

398
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
You like walking,

399
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,320
going to the cinema, museums.

400
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
Right, mum?

401
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,280
Me too, I like walking.

402
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,000
If you like, we could go on
long walks after lunch.

403
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,880
A little cake?

404
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,160
So you told us you like
to cook a lot as well.

405
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,600
Ah yes, cooking is one
of my little indulgences.

406
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,040
Do you like to cook?

407
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,840
Mum doesn't cook a lot
but she likes good food.

408
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,080
You like that.

409
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,720
Well, we should get along,
I'm rather greedy with food!

410
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,080
Me too.

411
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,280
So for example,
what do you like to cook?

412
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,800
Fish, vegetable gratins, soups...

413
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,800
I can also make cakes,
quiches, pancakes.

414
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Pancakes?

415
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,880
Yes.

416
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,040
Would you like me to make you some?

417
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,080
You can tell me if they're good.

418
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,080
Yes, OK.

419
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,880
- Where's the kitchen?
- Over there, on the left.

420
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,760
What do you think?

421
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,640
She won't win a beauty contest.

422
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,640
She seems nice though, right?

423
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,080
Yes, she's OK.

424
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,760
She arrives early,
she takes care of my mum all day

425
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,880
and she leaves when she's asleep.

426
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,640
I think my mum likes her.

427
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,520
It's a real relief for us.

428
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,240
She's just a little
authoritarian, that's all.

429
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,880
Let's stop there.

430
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,800
It's your turn, mum.

431
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,800
I know!

432
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,200
- Scrabble!
- Oh no!

433
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
There you go.

434
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,240
- Isn't that good?
- Bravo, Nina!

435
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,200
So tell me, darling,
how many points is that?

436
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,240
So, that's 12 plus 6 plus 7,

437
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,920
plus a triple word score,
plus 50 for the Scrabble.

438
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,240
- That's 147 points.
- There, you got 147.

439
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,760
That's not my last word!

440
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,400
You're leading.

441
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,520
This isn't happening!

442
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,960
Mum, what are you looking for?

443
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,960
Are you looking for something?

444
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,080
Me?

445
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,760
Isn't that my cheque book?

446
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,320
Yes.

447
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,080
I'm taking care of your bills.

448
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,240
You know, the water,
electricity, phone.

449
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,320
I can do it myself, I'm not crazy!

450
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,760
I know, mum, but as sometimes
you mess up the numbers,

451
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
we said I would write your cheques.

452
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,120
What are you talking about?

453
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,360
Are you going crazy?

454
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,200
- Shit!
- Don't get angry.

455
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,480
If you like, I'll fill in the cheque
and you can sign it.

456
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,400
OK.

457
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,080
I'm not crazy.

458
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,800
This is the cheque for EDF,
and you've only got to sign it.

459
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,080
Just here, mum.

460
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,280
I know.

461
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,920
Can I have it?

462
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,960
Mum! Stop!

463
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,080
Stop, mum! Stop!

464
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,560
Nina, Nina.

465
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,800
Sorry.

466
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,480
So, show me.

467
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,640
I don't know what I did,
but it's certain, I annoy her.

468
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,680
It's just because
you're there more often.

469
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,440
I irritate her as well.

470
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,800
She's only happy seeing Corinne.

471
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,080
They chat, they do stuff.

472
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,960
Sometimes I feel I'm bothering them.

473
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,720
Luckily we found her,
can you imagine if we hadn't?

474
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,120
She's great.

475
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,680
Just a little authoritarian.

476
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,280
"Can you go and get some bread?",

477
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,360
"Go hoover the living room."

478
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,800
She asked you to hoover?

479
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,400
She didn't ask you?

480
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,520
No.

481
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,160
That's strange.

482
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,640
It's her job to clean.
Don't give in like that!

483
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,560
I know,
but as she's also said stuff...

484
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,360
Said what?

485
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,360
Like where she worked before
there was a cleaning lady.

486
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,680
Perhaps they had a cleaning lady,

487
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,000
but for 1,800 euros a month,
she can lift a finger!

488
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,120
I dare her to ask me to hoover!

489
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,520
Well, it only happened
once or twice.

490
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,080
It's not worth discussing.

491
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,440
Since she arrived,
I've got my life back.

492
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,800
And I can sleep again.

493
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,560
So I walked, I walked...

494
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,520
Yes, mum, you walked in the street.

495
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,400
But you must go back to bed.

496
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,800
Yes, you've walked a lot,
but now you must sleep.

497
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Just listen to me!

498
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,280
Yes, we're listening, mum.

499
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,160
Tell us then, you walked...

500
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,400
In dog shit!

501
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,520
There you go.

502
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,960
What happened?

503
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,840
Mum was found in the street
in pyjamas at 2am.

504
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,520
She didn't know where she was.

505
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,600
A homeless man
took her to the police.

506
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,560
- Hi, Stéphane.
- Are you OK?

507
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,120
Then she remembered her name,
the cops called Mrs Perreira

508
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,000
who gave her Julie's number.

509
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,240
Tomorrow everyone will be gossiping!

510
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,560
Who broke the lock?

511
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,080
It must have been Mum.
Corinne locks it.

512
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,400
It smells of shit.

513
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,400
Yeah, can you deal with the door?

514
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,680
To make things worse,
she trod in shit.

515
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,400
There's something shinny inside,
she must have put a knife in.

516
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,680
Can you get me a plucker
from the bathroom, please?

517
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,720
- Not now?
- Yes, I can get it out!

518
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
No, you can call
a locksmith tomorrow.

519
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,400
I'll do it, seeing as you won't.

520
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,840
That's enough!

521
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,960
I woke up at 2am to help,
you could at least be nice.

522
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,720
Well, that was a first for you.

523
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,680
Oh, I see!

524
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Sort things out by yourself then.

525
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,560
Go home.
Me and Claire can stay.

526
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,000
No, he aggravates me.

527
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,800
He's like all men.
The second things aren't about him...

528
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,680
How did it go at school?

529
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,400
Very well, mum. Don't worry.
Good night.

530
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,040
Wait, we haven't said prayer.

531
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,520
Prayer now at 3am!

532
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,520
Quickly then,

533
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,680
because we've got school tomorrow.

534
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,120
Our father who are in heaven...

535
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,400
Really?

536
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,560
Whisky or vodka?

537
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,680
- Whisky!
- Vodka!

538
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
They've taken a hell
of a whack already!

539
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,120
I wonder whether Corinne
has a wee dram sometimes.

540
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,240
Do you think so?

541
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,320
Maybe mum's drinking them.

542
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,560
Can you imagine?

543
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,960
We reckon she's got Alzheimer's
but maybe she's just tipsy.

544
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,240
Whisky?

545
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,440
Isn't it bad to mix liquors?

546
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,040
If it were, it would be well known.

547
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,760
Well then!

548
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,240
To us!

549
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,960
To life! To love!

550
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,120
To the end of my relationship
with Vincent.

551
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,040
Don't pretend to be disappointed.

552
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,400
We're not disappointed,
we're surprised.

553
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,120
Well, don't act surprised.

554
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,480
It was always going to happen.

555
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,200
And how's it going?

556
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,440
Fab! It's the first day...

557
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,040
- Yeah.
- "The first day"?

558
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,280
Of the rest of my life.
That's the way.

559
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,680
My Alzheimer's is starting.

560
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,120
We're laughing,
but apparently it's hereditary.

561
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,440
Apparently.

562
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,440
We're heading straight there,
all of us!

563
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,560
The only thing I want
is to be ill first.

564
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,120
I don't want to hand you
over crutches.

565
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,600
You'd tell me right, if I...

566
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,200
Like we'd hold back!

567
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,320
Well, seeing as
you're talking about it,

568
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,840
the other day in your sleep,
you talked a lot about sodomy.

569
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,560
- You like it a lot.
- You do it a lot.

570
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,720
- It's important to do.
- You've always done a lot of it.

571
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,480
How surprising, I hate that.

572
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,120
Really?

573
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,520
That's not what Stéphane told us.

574
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,480
I'm telling you, I'm not surprised.

575
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,760
Every time I leave
and I lock the key in the door,

576
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,920
I wonder what I'll come back to
in the morning.

577
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,680
That's why we were wondering
if you could stay

578
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,080
for nights as well.

579
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,560
No, no.

580
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,880
I've got a life too, my husband...

581
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,680
It would just be 2 nights.
We can do the rest.

582
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,000
No, it's not possible.

583
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,200
It's already difficult
and hard work for me.

584
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,360
You know, doing the shopping,
the cleaning and taking care of her,

585
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,360
it's all very tiring.

586
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,760
You'll have to find
someone else for nights.

587
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,640
Corinne!

588
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,400
Hello, Nina.

589
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,320
What was the young one called
that didn't have any references?

590
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,000
Aicha.

591
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,360
80 euros.

592
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,320
70.

593
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,560
No, 80.

594
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,000
What about 75?

595
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,520
Listen, the price is
100 euros a night.

596
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,000
80 euros is good.

597
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,280
Right.

598
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,520
Yes, but as you won't declare it,

599
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,600
you won't pay any tax.

600
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,040
Neither will you.

601
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,520
Yes, but if we get caught,
we'll have problems and not you.

602
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,440
I understand.

603
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It doesn't matter.

604
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,920
Right, it's fine for 80 euros
but you arrive at 7.45 pm

605
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,720
and you leave at 8.15 am.

606
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,920
Except for Monday and Thursday,
when I can't get there before 9pm.

607
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,200
And we agree,
I'm not working weekends.

608
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,000
On the weekends,
we'll rotate between us.

609
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,160
But you start on Sunday night.

610
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
No problem.

611
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,160
So, 80 times 5, that's?

612
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,600
5,347.

613
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,800
You've made a mistake.

614
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,760
OK.

615
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,760
80 times 5, that's 400 a week.

616
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,320
So for a month that's 1,600,
plus Corinne's 1,800 euros,

617
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,560
plus 450 euros of tax, equals...

618
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,720
I wonder how poor people do it.

619
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,880
They keep the sick at their house,
like a long time ago.

620
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,280
5 people to look after mum,
it's becoming an industry.

621
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,880
Hello! It's Odile!

622
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It's me!

623
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,080
It's Corinne!

624
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,480
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

625
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,720
Bye, Nina.
Have a good weekend, till Monday.

626
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,480
Sorry.

627
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,440
- Did it go well?
- Very well.

628
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,760
What about Aicha?

629
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,000
Well, we'll manage with her.

630
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,600
Oh, and the nails have
nothing to do with me.

631
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,560
- Have a good weekend.
- You too.

632
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,760
Good evening, mum.

633
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,200
Good evening.

634
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,280
Look at that.

635
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,160
That's soft!

636
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,360
I sell these in my shop.

637
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,760
Do you want to try it on?

638
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,720
Yes.

639
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,560
It suits you.

640
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,200
It's yours, if you want it.

641
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,560
Thanks, darling.

642
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,400
Thanks a lot.

643
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,720
Well, it's nothing,
I'm happy to give it to you.

644
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,640
You're nice.

645
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,440
You were always the nicest

646
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,600
and the most gentle.

647
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,440
My little girl.

648
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,280
I love you so much.

649
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,640
No, don't be sad.

650
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,680
My little darling, don't be sad.

651
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,560
I'm not sad.

652
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,000
My sweetness.

653
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,560
- Oh, mum.
- Yes, darling, I'm here.

654
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,280
I think it's the first time that
mum told me she loved me.

655
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,400
Odile says she doesn't know
who she's talking to anymore.

656
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,360
I think she's just jealous.

657
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,800
I'm sure that my mother was
really speaking to me yesterday.

658
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,520
I'm the one she loved.

659
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,120
We'll stop there.

660
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,560
It's Odile!

661
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,760
Hello, Corinne. All OK?

662
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,680
Yes, yes, all's fine.

663
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,640
Do you have 5 minutes?
I'd like to speak with you.

664
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
Yes.

665
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,320
I've got a problem with Aicha.

666
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,480
- What's going on?
- She doesn't speak nicely to me.

667
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,880
There's hardly ever a nice hello.
She doesn't tidy.

668
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,440
When I arrive in the morning, I have
to clear away her breakfast.

669
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,160
She doesn't rinse the bath,

670
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,880
your mum's bed is never made,

671
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,800
and at night she's always late.

672
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,080
She says I'm not her boss,
but I'm not her housewife!

673
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,920
Is it an organisation problem?

674
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,680
Perhaps you can decide
together who does what

675
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,560
and each of you can try
to respect that.

676
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,520
Well, that's not all.

677
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,880
I suppose she didn't tell you
that she brings her boyfriend.

678
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,160
What should we do now?

679
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,360
We go up and say we've come
to get something, like a file.

680
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,320
Why don't we speak to her
instead of catching her out?

681
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,640
We will speak to her, don't worry!

682
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,680
Good evening.

683
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,240
I think she understood.

684
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,440
With what you said,
she won't stay long.

685
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,320
She brings a guy over to mum's
and I'm the mean one?

686
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,320
You are completely looney!

687
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,080
We're nice to have not fired her.

688
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,680
We didn't fire her
because we need her!

689
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,760
She gave me a bad feeling
from the start.

690
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,640
Why?
Because she's called Aicha?

691
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,120
Yeah, right, call me a racist!

692
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,640
Stop it, you're too much!

693
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,360
We could let Aicha breathe for 2 days
and get someone else?

694
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,760
So we're paying her now to breathe?

695
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,160
Stop making it all about money!

696
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,720
But of course, I'm racist,
I'm tight, everyone knows!

697
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,720
I'm sure money is not
a problem for you.

698
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,840
What are you trying to say?

699
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,360
When you go twice a week to
a shrink, you've got the money.

700
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,200
I go once, not twice,
and it's none of your business.

701
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,600
You can talk, you've never worked.

702
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,200
Just because you play
the saleswoman...

703
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,560
That's enough!

704
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,760
Is this the best time to fight?
Isn't it hard enough right now?

705
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,560
You're pissing me off
with your good wife crap!

706
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,600
Don't you want a lift home?

707
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,840
These t-shirts are very good,
very comfortable to wear.

708
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,160
- There you go.
- Here.

709
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,280
That's perfect.

710
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,760
- Thanks. See you soon.
- Thanks.

711
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,760
Hello.

712
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,600
Are you free for lunch?

713
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,880
I saw an Italian on this street.

714
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,400
Right, I'm sorry about what I said.

715
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,120
You've got to stop bullying everyone.

716
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,040
We're lucky there's 3 of us
and mum has some money.

717
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,440
- Can you imagine other people?
- OK!

718
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,080
I said I was sorry.

719
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,680
Corinne and Aicha aren't  perfect,
but it works.

720
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,640
Enjoy it.
It'll last for as long as it must.

721
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,480
That's very pretty.

722
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,520
- How much is it?
- 85 euros.

723
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,120
I'll take it.

724
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,760
Do you want the matching bag?

725
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,480
It's Corinne!

726
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,680
Nina!

727
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,000
Aicha!

728
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:42,520
Nina!

729
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,000
Oh well, it didn't last long.

730
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,720
What?

731
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,800
The non-perfect couple that works!

732
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,680
So?

733
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,160
I spoke to her, she said she just
went out to do some shopping.

734
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,920
Well, of course.
We go food shopping at 2 am too.

735
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,920
She wants us to pay her
holiday leave as well.

736
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,160
Does she think we're stupid?

737
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,520
- No, just you.
- What?

738
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,640
She said you were a stupid racist

739
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,120
and if we don't pay, she'll send
her boyfriend over to hurt you.

740
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,280
Did she say that?

741
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,520
Mum!

742
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,040
How do you feel?

743
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,960
I want to go home.

744
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,360
I'll call Corinne to tell her
to take her holidays

745
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,960
and she can come back at the end
of August, when mum will be back.

746
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,000
Let's not keep lying to ourselves.

747
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,360
Mum can't go back to her flat.

748
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,040
What are you saying?

749
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,840
Well, surely you can see
we can't manage.

750
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,440
Aicha was the straw.

751
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,400
Even Corinne is hard work,
always complaining.

752
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,720
Managing 2 people is a nightmare.

753
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,960
That's not counting a 3rd person
for weekends.

754
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,440
Well, having said that...

755
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,600
What do you suggest then?

756
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,520
She'll need to go into
a special care home.

757
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,120
A place for people like her.

758
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,600
Are you talking about
the ones in wheel chairs

759
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,720
who spend their days
whining and dribbling?

760
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,800
Can you see mum with those people?

761
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,800
She's sick, Odile.

762
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,360
She doesn't even see
what's happening anymore.

763
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,040
She's lucid enough to realise that
we're leaving her in an asylum.

764
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,200
The flat is all she remembers now.

765
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,160
If we take that away...

766
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,440
Odile,
it's difficult enough as it is,

767
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,080
try not to make it more complicated.

768
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,840
- Have you decided?
- Not yet.

769
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,240
- I'll give you more time.
- Sorry.

770
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,480
So obviously you're OK with this.

771
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,960
I would like there to be another
solution, but I don't see one.

772
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,800
So that's it.

773
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,200
So you've got together on this one.

774
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,720
With everything mum has done for us,

775
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,720
the exemplary way
she brought us up,

776
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,000
and this is how you thank her?

777
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,440
By putting her in a hospice?

778
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,640
She's not going to a hospice!
Why would you say that?

779
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,800
- We'll find a nice place.
- Does one exist?

780
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,920
Claire, have you heard
what they say on TV?

781
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,560
They stuff people with tranquilisers
and they tie them to beds.

782
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,080
I'm ashamed of you.

783
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,240
If dad could hear or see you,

784
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,400
he would turn in his grave.

785
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,840
I'll take care of her.

786
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,840
- What are you going to do?
- Take her to mine.

787
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,480
You know why she's doing this?

788
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,720
To make us feel guilty!

789
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,640
She's always acted like this,

790
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,720
the perfect girl who does
everything perfectly.

791
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,400
I'm sorry, but she's got
an issue with mum.

792
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,960
It's not normal to put
herself out this much.

793
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,080
It must be a childhood thing
that she can't get over.

794
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,320
Maybe it's because
her kids have gone.

795
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,840
She doesn't speak about it, but...

796
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,920
You know what?

797
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,640
She should get a psychiatrist.

798
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,840
And go at least 3 times a week!

799
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,400
God, what will the menopause be like?

800
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,400
I know one person who'll be happy

801
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,120
when he gets the good news.

802
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,000
Do you understand
what you're asking me?

803
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,880
But you won't see her a lot.

804
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,720
When you get back, she'll be asleep.

805
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,680
You'll only see her the weekend.

806
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,240
We'll never be alone again.

807
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,040
She doesn't bother anyone.

808
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,400
You know, she barely speaks anymore.

809
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,000
When the kids left the house,
I was hoping for something else.

810
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,800
Like what? What did you want?

811
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,760
Well, not to be a care home.

812
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,840
I love your mum,
but that's not really the point.

813
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,640
In any case,
it won't be until September.

814
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,760
In a week she'll be out
and we'll go to Etretat.

815
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,520
I'm sorry, Odile,
but I'm not OK with this.

816
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,560
What are you doing?

817
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,640
I'm going to mum's,
seeing as you don't want her.

818
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,160
Let go of me!

819
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,880
I would have looked
after your parents.

820
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,200
I would never ask.

821
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,000
They won't dry, it's too humid.

822
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,960
She's finished them all.

823
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,440
Don't throw them out,
we can reuse them.

824
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,640
When are we going to go swimming?

825
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,920
You can't go swimming mum,
you've got a plaster cast.

826
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,680
She's said that 100 times.

827
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,880
When are we going to go swimming?

828
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,520
Why can't we take her?

829
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,240
With her plaster cast?
Don't be stupid.

830
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,080
She really wants to, right, my Nina?

831
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,160
Well, I want to jump off
a cliff to fly away.

832
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,280
We don't always get what we want.

833
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,800
You could try,
with that wind outside.

834
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,160
What if we protected
the plaster cast,

835
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,120
and were careful?

836
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,400
What if water gets in?
Do we take it off and dry it?

837
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,160
When are we going swimming?

838
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,680
Well, rolling up kitchen roll
is a lot less risky.

839
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,960
When you look after
your grandmother like us...

840
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,240
I'll take care of her, don't worry.

841
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
Where's the bin bags?

842
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,360
- No, I can't do this.
- Hold on, Nina!

843
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,320
Go in, come on.

844
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,600
Come and sit down.

845
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,160
Do you want to drink something?

846
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,960
Are you OK, mum?
Are you tired?

847
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,840
I'm fine.

848
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,200
Are you happy to be here?

849
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,880
I want to go home.

850
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,440
You're home, mum.
This is your flat, can't you see?

851
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,280
I want to go home.

852
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,600
You were
the best daughter possible, Odile.

853
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,320
You did all that you could.

854
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,480
I know.

855
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,920
You were the best out of us.

856
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,040
Even if you're the most annoying.

857
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,320
I know.

858
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,880
We'll find her a great care home.

859
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,040
A place to put her furniture,
her valuables and her memories.

860
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,200
- We'll go and see her a lot.
- OK.

861
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,600
You've got to stop crying
otherwise we'll all start.

862
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,880
Wisteria Retirement Home

863
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:48,440
Put your leg to the side
and lift your arm.

864
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,480
Pinch me, I'm dreaming!

865
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,920
Hello, M'am.

866
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,640
This is unreal,
there must be a catch.

867
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,440
The beautiful star

868
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,160
1,300 euros per month?

869
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,600
Oh no, Madam, per week.
That's not including medical charges

870
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,920
and the hairdressing
and other services.

871
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,200
Of course.

872
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,320
Yes?

873
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,440
Excuse me, Mr Farina
has come for his father's file.

874
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,400
Ah, yes.

875
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,160
- Excuse me.
- Please go ahead.

876
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,560
So we found the catch.

877
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,640
You can cut her hair.
I'll take care of her feet.

878
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,760
Without all that, it still costs
5,000 euros a month!

879
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,760
We'll say we're interested
and we'll discuss the price later.

880
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,120
Do you want to think about it?

881
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,320
There's no need, we're interested.

882
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,320
I'll put you
on the waiting list then.

883
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,360
Are there no openings?

884
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,640
No, we're full. Spots open up
when someone dies.

885
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,840
And how long can that be?

886
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,200
From a few weeks to a few months.

887
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,560
How much will we get
without the flat rent?

888
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,440
1,052 euros.

889
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,000
It's a rent deal from 48.

890
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,760
I can help out,
I've asked to do more shifts.

891
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,160
I can work on Saturdays.

892
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,200
We've got to find a long term
solution. Mum is young.

893
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,720
It's nice of you.

894
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,480
The only solution I can see
is to sell Etretat.

895
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,480
Oh no!

896
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,600
No, not Etretat!

897
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,080
Etretat is our whole life,
our childhood.

898
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,040
Mum will be done with.

899
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,200
Etretat will be over.

900
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,920
Everything will be over.

901
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,720
Look at that,
they're taking air and chatting.

902
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,880
They have no desire to die,
I'm telling you!

903
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,720
Some cyanide in their food
and we're sorted.

904
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,000
Stop it, I don't want to laugh.

905
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,440
Odile is upset to sell Etretat.

906
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,080
She's attached to the past.

907
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,080
When Julie has decided something,
she goes straight ahead.

908
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,360
Curiously, for me,
I don't feel a thing.

909
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,200
In any case, not as much
as I would think.

910
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,360
I even think

911
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,920
that it could help me turn a page,

912
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,600
to leave the past behind.

913
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,000
- Grow.
- We'll stop there.

914
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,080
Did you hear what I said?

915
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,960
Wasn't it important?

916
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,080
I've come here for a year
and told you everything

917
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,480
and you just sit there
and look at me.

918
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,320
When I pay you,
would it hurt a little to say thanks?

919
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,040
Driving School

920
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,080
And how are things?

921
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,640
I've had easier periods in my life.

922
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,360
Odile is very unhappy, you know.

923
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,400
But she's stubborn as a mule.

924
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,080
Proud as a peacock.

925
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,080
But she's nice deep down.
You know her as well as us.

926
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,520
Yes.

927
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,640
Have you managed to chat a bit?

928
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,960
Yes, yes, things are calming down.

929
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,800
It's been good for us to be apart.

930
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,040
I think she needs to really go
the extra mile with your mum.

931
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,640
We're going through a rough patch,
but it'll get better.

932
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,080
Did you know we found a care home?

933
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,240
Yes, I know.

934
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,400
I know you're selling Etretat too.

935
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,560
That's why I wanted to see you.

936
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,080
Would you be OK
if I bought the house?

937
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,920
That way it'll stay in the family,

938
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,360
you can still go there,
it'll still be your home.

939
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,120
Is Odile aware of this?

940
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,680
I wanted to speak to you first.

941
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,640
We're OK with that.

942
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,360
In any case, I'm OK with that.

943
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,080
You just need to know something.

944
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,240
It's going to cost you!

945
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,760
There you go, mum.

946
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,360
If you're too hot,
take off the top cover.

947
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,920
OK?

948
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,920
Did you look under the bed?

949
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,920
Last night, I was attacked by foxes.

950
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,360
Really? By foxes?

951
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,680
They made a din
like you wouldn't imagine.

952
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,640
They ran all over the room,
they even knocked over the lamp.

953
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,840
Listen, I can't see anything.

954
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,960
They must have left.

955
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,800
I was attacked by a fox
when I was little.

956
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,360
At your grandmother's
in Salzburg, right?

957
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,520
Look.

958
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,840
So, you, who are you?

959
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,120
Well,

960
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,920
I'm Odile, mum.

961
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,720
I'm your little girl.

962
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,720
Oh, right.
So you're not Mrs Perreira?

963
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,720
Really, do you think I even have a
vague look of Mrs Perreira about me?

964
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,640
Well, now you've said it...

965
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,720
I'm off, someone's here.

966
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,560
Good evening.

967
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,360
Can I come in?

968
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,720
Yes, of course, come in.

969
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,840
I had Juliette on the phone.

970
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,080
She did well in her exams.

971
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,960
Yes, I think she was happy.

972
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:00,680
No, go ahead.

973
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,440
Yanis said he was coming home
on the 10th.

974
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,800
Will you be free?

975
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,800
The 10th? Yes, yes.

976
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,400
Good.

977
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,960
I asked your sisters
if I could buy Etretat.

978
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,400
I thought

979
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,360
that you could perhaps
come back to the house

980
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,360
with your mum, until she moves.

981
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,080
I think it's going to be
a big shock to leave here,

982
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,440
I think we should stay here
till the end.

983
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,800
Yes, OK.

984
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,080
But thank you!

985
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,160
Hello?

986
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,560
Yes?

987
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,400
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

988
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,240
- Till Thursday.
- Till Thursday, yes.

989
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,880
Yes, hello?

990
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,560
That's it, there's a free spot.

991
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,680
It's better this way, you know.

992
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,440
Don't take the cashmere.

993
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,480
They said only machine washable
and preferably non-iron clothes.

994
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,000
She can't just wear acrylic things.

995
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,960
Yeah, you're right.

996
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,840
We'll wash
her nice clothes ourselves.

997
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,600
When you were small,

998
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,520
I could watch you from here
going to school.

999
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,240
Before going round the corner,
you would always wave.

1000
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,120
You should have told me of the risk.

1001
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,160
When women have sex with men,

1002
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,160
they can get pregnant, Vincent.

1003
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,960
You haven't just learned
that today, I hope.

1004
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,440
When men don't want that hassle,
they wear a condom.

1005
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,560
I'm as guilty as you,
that's not what I'm saying.

1006
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,560
What are you saying then?

1007
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,880
Sophie is pregnant.

1008
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,040
She'll give birth in 3 months.

1009
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,440
But, if you need me to...

1010
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,000
To get an abortion?
No, I don't need you.

1011
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,360
Well, it's your choice.

1012
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,640
Are you sure
you don't want to keep it?

1013
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,280
Alone, with my work?

1014
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,720
You could get a nanny,

1015
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,720
with references,

1016
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,680
and partially declare the money.

1017
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,840
A Corinne for babies.

1018
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,440
Seriously, can you imagine me
with a baby?

1019
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,040
Good bye and good day.

1020
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:34,840
So?

1021
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,000
I heard its heartbeat.

1022
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,800
Did he say when it was for?

1023
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,880
The 15th of July!

1024
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,440
Your tights are very flashy.

1025
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,120
I like them, don't you?

1026
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,680
Yes, but they're very flashy.

1027
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,560
I'm hot!

1028
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,520
Oh!

1029
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,440
You're expecting a baby?

1030
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:10,000
Well, yes, mum.
I told you, it's a little girl.

1031
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,040
I've got 3 little girls too.

1032
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,240
Oh yeah?

1033
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,760
What are they called?

1034
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,240
I don't know that.

1035
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,160
In any case, they're very pretty.
Everyone compliments me.

1036
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,560
Are they well behaved?

1037
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,320
The two small ones, yes.
The oldest one has some character!

1038
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,520
I always have to tell her off.

1039
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,000
I know her,
she's as stubborn as a mule.

1040
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,800
She looks like Mrs Perreira,
doesn't she?

1041
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,160
Yeah. Are you sure it's Saturday?

1042
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,760
OK, then. No problem.

1043
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:53,720
I did it!

1044
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,520
What?

1045
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,640
My mum passed her driving test.

1046
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,960
Is it heavy? Should I carry it?

1047
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,160
No, of course not.

1048
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,680
You're crazy, cherries?
She doesn't like them.

1049
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,640
Hello.

1050
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,680
There's a problem with your mum.

1051
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,760
Have you looked in all the rooms?

1052
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,640
Yes, we searched
all the buildings and annexes.

1053
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,680
This has never happened before,
I don't understand.

1054
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,120
Where did you see her last?

1055
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,560
She bathed at 8 am, she had
breakfast with the orange group,

1056
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,080
then she painted.

1057
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,480
This never happens.

1058
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,520
Are you sure she went to paint?

1059
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,560
Yes, but she disappeared
before returning.

1060
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,160
It was at lunch
that we realised she had gone.

1061
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,840
This never happens!

1062
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,080
Yes, Madam, it's happening now!

1063
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,240
Did she have visitors?

1064
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,360
Her grandson, Guillaume Pelletier.

1065
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,640
Hello?

1066
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,680
Yeah, she's here next to me.

1067
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,280
Very well.
We took the train then a coach.

1068
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,240
We've just arrived at Etretat.

1069
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,240
Swimming, mum.
Remember, it's her birthday.

1070
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,640
No, don't hand me over to Odile.

1071
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,360
Hello?

1072
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,480
I'm off, Odile.
It's cutting out.

1073
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,440
Shit! They're pissed!

1074
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,760
You'll have to stand up for me.

1075
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,160
You're not keeping
the right distance from that car.

1076
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,640
You should stay two car lengths away.

1077
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,040
Look twice before overtaking, Odile.

1078
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,600
The blind spot. Sorry,
but I can't let that one pass.

1079
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,360
One more comment, and you're out.

1080
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,440
Have we gone past the toll?

1081
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,400
- Where is she?
- I don' t know.

1082
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,120
I went quickly to buy water.

1083
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,720
I asked her to wait.
When I came back, she had gone.

1084
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,800
I think she's in the water!

1085
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,240
What the hell, Guillaume!

1086
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,880
Are you happy, little moron?

1087
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,200
Don't touch my son!

1088
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,920
It's my job to shout at him!

1089
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,800
Shout then!
Why are you waiting?

1090
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,000
I'm sorry.

1091
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,640
Look!

1092
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,920
Mum!

1093
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,360
Nina!

1094
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,000
She's crazy, she's totally crazy.

1095
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,960
Ah! This one's for you, mum.

1096
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,720
The capital of Germany?

1097
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,200
That would be nice
but with some milk.

1098
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:32,680
We're here!

1099
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,280
Hello!

1100
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,200
Look who's here, mum!

1101
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,440
- Hello, mum.
- Hello.

1102
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,400
Hello.

1103
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,160
How's it going?

1104
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,480
This is my little girl.

1105
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,520
She was born the same day as you.

1106
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,240
Put her in her arms.

1107
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,600
- Really?
- Yes, we're here.

1108
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,600
Wait, wait.

1109
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,600
Here, mum.

1110
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,880
You're so pretty!

1111
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,320
You understand.

1112
