- Oh, okay.

533
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,767
She was in a traveling
theater company.

534
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,047
I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada.

535
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,726
So across the street from my house
there was this little library

536
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,404
that had an old movie section.

537
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,923
So she took me and we spent an entire day
watching all these old movies

538
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,050
like <i>Notorious</i> and <i>Bringing Up Baby</i>
and <i>Casablanca.</i>

539

- And...
- [man] Cut it there! Cut!

- [crew member] Check the gate.
- So we can talk now.

541
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,603
- She sounds incredible.
- She was incredible.

542
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,286
And I would put on all these plays
in my bedroom,

543
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,605
and it would basically just be she and I
re-enacting those scenes from the movies.

544
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,091
And then I would
write my own plays.

545
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,730
- Wow.
- Um... Yeah.

546
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,240

548
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,689
So anyway, I left college
after two years to come here

549
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,604
and my last audition was
for a teen show

550
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,842
pitched as <i>"Dangerous Minds</i>
meets <i>The O.C."</i>

551

been a lawyer.

needs more lawyers.

You're not
just an actress.

555
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,366
- What do you mean, "just an actress"?
- You said it yourself.

as interesting as you are,

for this...

- He made history, didn't he?

It just means that when I listen to it,
I don't like it.

574
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,764
Yeah, but it's such a blanket statement
you don't like jazz.

576
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,851

[jazz music playing]

578

when they say that they...

580
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,966
They don't have context, they don't know
where it comes from.

581
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,681
Jazz was born in a little
flophouse in New Orleans,

582
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,776
and it's just because people
were crammed in there,

583
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,416
they spoke five different languages,
they couldn't talk to each other.

584
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,240
The only way they could communicate
was with jazz.

585
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,731

- What about it?
- From my life?

590
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,761
- Mmm-hmm?
- I just find it relaxing.

591
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,241
It's not relaxing.
It's not, it's not.

592
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,449
Sidney Bechet shot somebody because
they told him he played a wrong note.

593
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,760
That's hardly relaxing.

594
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,050
Yeah, but where I grew up there was
this station called K-jazz 103.

595
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,016
And people would just put on that station
when they had a cocktail party...

596
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,280
Right.

597
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,522

- 'Cause it was...
- That's the prob...

600
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,567
Okay, okay. So I think
that's part of the problem,

601
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,496
is that you can't hear it, you know?
You have to see it.

602
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,856

He's got his own idea.

610
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,168
