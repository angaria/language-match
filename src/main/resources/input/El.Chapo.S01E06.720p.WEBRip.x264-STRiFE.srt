[police officer] I'm
going to check your trunk.

186
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,159
[police officer] Why are
you going to El Salvador?

187
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,578
[Toño] To visit some
friends in Barillas.

188
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,496
You may continue.
Welcome to El Salvador.

189

Welcome to El Salvador.

195
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,133
Thank you for coming.

196
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,636
[Conrado] <i>Did you
get what you needed?</i>

197
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,429
I have all the pieces to
start building the puzzle.

198
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,514
<i>Great.</i>

199
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,598
See you soon.

200
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,519
[Saavedra] <i>You are really brave</i>
<i>for wanting to relive the past.</i>

201
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,689
I was brave when I reported him
to the district attorney's office.

202
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,568
But just as he'd warned
me, it was useless.

203
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,573
Your story will be invaluable.

204
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,742
If I may, I'll record this.

205
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,581
[woman] <i>I'm not
afraid of him anymore.</i>

206
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,751
<i>At that time I was afraid.
I was only 18 years old.</i>

207
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,422
He threatened me to kill
my family if I spoke.

208
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,133
Thank God, I had the
support of my family.

209
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,094
<i>I gave them the description,
everything they needed,</i>

210
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,971
<i>but nothing happened.</i>

211
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,558
That bastard never
paid for what he'd done.

00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,979
[automated typing]

213
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,887
I have the men Rosado asked for.

214
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,097
The shipment is protected.

215
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,434
I need to know how many
people are keeping watch.

216
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,270
This is the address.

217
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,981
And this is what we've
agreed to pay you.

00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,539
SAN LORENZO NEIGHBORHOOD
SAN SALVADOR, EL SALVADOR

219
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,938
[in English] Anything?

220
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,901
[in English] Nothing. All quiet.

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,660
CHAPO'S WAREHOUSE SAN
LORENZO NEIGHBORHOOD

222
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,662
Who's that? [In
Spanish] Do you know him?

223
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,419
Yes, he lives in the neighborhood.

224
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,295
[in English] Should I take a look?

225
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,009
[in English] No, it's okay. He's clean.

226
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,221
I'll go fetch some
empanadas. Do you want some?

227
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,849
[in English] Yes, please.
Five without chili.

228
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,476
We call it <i>ají </i>here.

229
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,769
Well, same thing, right?

230
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,585
We'll take the blow from here.

231
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,463
We'll take it to Cuba...

232
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,632
and then directly to Miami.

233
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,220
We have to make this
route something big, Toño.

234
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,522
Do you think we'll go
back to Mexico some day?

235
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,260
Do you want some sauce with that?

236
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,222
No, the <i>gringos</i>
cannot eat spicy food.

237
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,057
I'll just put tomatoes, then.

238
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,611
- How many are there?
- He just said they were <i>gringos.</i>

239
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,324
Tell me, kid, what did they buy?

240
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,118
<i>Empanadas, </i>no chili.

241
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,912
How many with no chili?

242
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,455
Eh... five.

243
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,883
[drug trafficker] <i>The situation</i>
<i>is worst than we thought.</i>

244
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,220
The DEA is watching your shipment.

245
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,305
Are you 100% sure?

246
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,017
Yes, sir, there are at least five.

247
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,313
And I checked with
my contact in Customs.

248
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,982
They entered through Mexico.

249
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,567
Damn it.

250
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,652
What do you want to do, boss?

251
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,655
Get your men ready.

252
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,492
I'm sorry, what?

253
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,160
Let's get the shipment.

254
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,705
But sir...

255
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,083
We cannot go against the DEA.

256
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,543
- [cocks gun]
- You'll do as I say!

257
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,337
That's why I'm paying
you, son of a bitch! Eh?

258
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,219
Get out of here.

259
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,431
We'll call you later.

260
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,187
I know we need that shipment,

261
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,148
but we cannot mess with the DEA.

262
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,442
Remember what happened
to Quintero and Neto

263
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,360
over the Kiki Camarena issue.

264
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,487
There's always a way, Toño.

265
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,324
Nobody believed in my tunnel,
but there's always a way out.

266
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,159
[shooting]

267
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,579
[shooting continues]

268
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,795
Stop! Come on! Come on!

269
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,351
[police officer] Secure the area!

270
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,366
[police sirens wailing]

271
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,869
- [car passing]
- [sirens recede]

272
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,376
[sighs]

273
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,961
It will be published tomorrow.

274
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,607
Thank you for coming.

275
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,610
I wanted to say goodbye personally.

276
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,654
Say goodbye?

277
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,823
I'm leaving Mexico as soon as possible.

278
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,493
Once your article appears
in tomorrow's newspaper,

279
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,537
General Blanco won't
stop until finding out

280
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,038
who leaked that information.

281
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,916
I won't say a word,
you can rest assured.

282
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,876
I don't betray my sources.

283
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,378
I know that.

284
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,338
And I'm really thankful.

285
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,552
I'd like to ask you for a
personal favor before leaving.

286
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,928
Mm-hmm?

287
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,265
Can you give me a copy of your article?

288
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,811
I'm afraid I won't have access
to your newspaper after I'm gone.

289
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,604
And I wouldn't like to
miss the chance to feel

290
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,733
the pleasure of reading the article
that will finish the General.

291
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,197
[Toño] Yes, sir.

292
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,912
I'll tell the boss.

293
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,394
This is all I could get for you.

294
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,532
I gave Lora all the instructions.

295
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,413
We'll have to give Herrerías
all the money we have

296
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,123
so we can work for him.

297
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,293
It'd mean going back to square
one, but if he takes us in,

298
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,170
we'll be protected by his organization.

299
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,718
If you want to go back to
Mexico, you're free to do so.

300
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,471
I'll always have your back.

301
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,432
You managed to be at the top over
there, and you'll do the same here.

302
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,810
Well, then...

303
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,770
Let's find another way
to cross the border,

304
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,188
even if we have to become moles.

305
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,648
[laughing]

306
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,900
And I won't get into that trunk again.

307
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:43,652
Not even for 30 minutes.

308
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,529
- [keys clink]
- Come on, let's go.

309
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,969
GUATEMALA CITY GUATEMALA

310
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,054
[Rosado] When do you
want to meet Herrerías?

311
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,974
[Lora] As soon as possible.

312
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,018
<i>Things didn't go as
planned in El Salvador.</i>

313
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,784
[sighs]

314
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,536
They should have arrived already.

315
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,166
[door opening]

316
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,667
Finally.

317
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,339
What happened with the meeting?

318
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,632
It's settled.

319
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,510
Rosado and Herrerías will wait
for you in the Panamericano Hotel.

320
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,148
Boss.

321
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,570
Thanks for everything, Lora.

322
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,865
I'm sorry I have to go, but
I need to go back to Mexico.

323
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,241
Call me if you need anything.

324
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,591
We have 1.5 million.

325
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,026
[Joaquín] What's with all the security?

326
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,110
PANAMERICANO HOTEL GUATEMALA CITY

327
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,987
You don't trust Herrerías?

328
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,031
Herrerías is like that
when he leaves his house.

329
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,158
He wants extra security.

330
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,411
Go ahead.

331
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,933
- Where's Herrerías?
- [cocking guns]

332
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,226
[Rosado] He's not coming.

333
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,022
Let's do this the right way,
Chapo. I don't want you to get hurt.

334
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,609
It's a shame that your business
in El Salvador didn't work, but...

335
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,987
this is your new reality.

336
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,574
The price for your head is
an opportunity we cannot miss.

337
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,619
If this is about money,
let's talk about it.

338
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,581
I can be more generous
than the government.

339
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,083
If you let me go, I'll
give you 1.5 million.

340
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,587
[Joaquín] 500,000 more than the reward.

341
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,881
With that money you can retire.

342
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,989
[knocking on door]

343
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,760
- [punch and moaning]
- [Joaquín] Hey! Hey!

344
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,387
[frightened panting]

345
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,390
[groaning]

346
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,853
[Joaquín] You fucking
traitor! Son of a...!

347
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,940
[Toño groaning]

348
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,594
[Rosado] I need to
speak with the President.

349
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,138
From Lieutenant Rosado.

350
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,310
Good evening, Mr. President.

351
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:30,105
I'd like to inform you that
we've captured El Chapo Guzmán.

352
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,490
Thank you very much, from the President.

353
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,367
We won't forget how helpful you were.

354
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,621
General Blanco will
coordinate the operation.

355
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,207
I don't want any information
leaked to the press.

356
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,919
I want the news to be out tomorrow,
once I'm at the border with him.

357
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,504
All right, General.

358
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,851
Amado.

359
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,938
<i>El Chapo was detained
in Guatemala.</i>

360
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,580
GENERAL BLANCO, THE PRESIDENT'S
RIGHT HAND AND UNPUNISHED CRIMINAL

361
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,457
[President] What's this?

362
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,793
I found it by chance.

363
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,921
My contact informs me that
it will be published tomorrow.

364
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,008
We have some time to stop it.

365
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,845
[intercom]

366
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,766
Lucía, please, telephone the owner
of the <i>El Global </i>newspaper.

367
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,392
[Lucía] <i>Of course, sir.</i>

368
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,102
- [intercom]
- Good job, Conrado.

369
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,897
You deserve a promotion.

370
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,441
[telephone ringing]

371
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,070
[President] Peralta, what's
going on in your newspaper?

372
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:03,406
I've just read an article
by Gabriela Saavedra.

373
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,699
What's that all about?

374
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,578
It's not important how I found out.

375
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,789
What's important here is
the content of that article.

376
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,582
It's unacceptable.

377
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,131
- [airplanes taking off]
- [radios buzzing]

378
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,993
Good morning.

379
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,676
[sighs]

380
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,104

381
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,981
- [shooting]
- [in English] Go, go, go, go!

382
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,364
Put your hands up!

383
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:30,285
- Everybody, that's right.
- Get down, get down.

384
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,911
Get down, motherfucker.

385
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,581
Put him down.

386
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,417
Everybody start making this.
Yeah, that's right, punk.

387
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,336
Load the van! Load the van!

388
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,298
- Come on!
- Get up! Get up! Get up!

389

MILITARY HEADQUARTERS
GUATEMALA - MEXICO BORDER

390
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,026
[Rosado] Put those two in that truck.

391
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,112
El Chapo goes in my truck.

392
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,748
[groaning]

393
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,920
[Rosado] Let's go!

394
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,463
[Joaquín] <i>Rayito.</i>

395
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,674
- What's up, buddy?
- A toast to this great life!

396
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,550
[laughing]

397
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,514
Here you are, GÃ¼ero, take
it. This is pure power.

398
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,058
This is freedom, GÃ¼ero! Look!

399
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,267
This is great!

400
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,273
[Joaquín] <i>Keep
playing, my friends!</i>

401
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:25,400
Keep playing, man!

402

[opening the airplane's door]

403
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,160
[Joaquín] <i>This
is the real power.</i>

404
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:38,678
<i>This is freedom!</i>
