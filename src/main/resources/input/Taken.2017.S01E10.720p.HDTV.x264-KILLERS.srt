1
00:00:00,074 --> 00:00:02,965
Asha Flynn. 29 years old.
Junior associate at an

2
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:05,425
environmental law firm here in D.C.

3
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:07,580
Only child of Marcus and Esme Flynn.

4
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,684
And, apparently, reading
between the lines

5
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:12,117
on the emails we got from
her personal computer,

6
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:14,823
- now in a relationship with Bryan.
- Police believe she was

7
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:16,789
taken about 6:30 last night

8
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:20,097
in this van caught here by
an external security camera,

9
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:22,595
part of a recently installed
state-of-the-art alarm system.

10
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:25,458
Still no word from Bryan. Radio silence.

11
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:29,401
All he's gonna care about
now is getting her back.

12
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:32,317
So we have to stop him.

13
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:37,115
For his own good.

14
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:02,349
There's some people say I should
go on one of them singing shows.

15
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,770
- You should.
- Maybe I will.

16
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:06,672
Who knows?

17
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,022
What about you? Any hidden talents?

18
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:12,578
I can cook.

19
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:21,287
If you don't mind me asking,
you in some kind of trouble?

20
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:27,459
Someone took my girlfriend.

21
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:29,254
To Texas?

22
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:31,931
Maybe.

23
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,158
This is one of my favorites.

24
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:44,510
Hey.

25
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:46,336
I hope you find her.

26
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,276
I will.

27
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,954
Two minutes.

28
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:39,479
Talk to you boyfriend.

29
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,789
We need to keep him motivated.

30
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:54,712
Bryan, help me.

31
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,550
Asha...

32
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:00,866
Help me, Bryan.

33
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,914
I know that he's there with you.

34
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,982
I know that he can hear me.

35
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:10,660
I need you to listen very carefully.

36
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:13,309
I am coming.

37
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:17,703
I will find you,

38
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:19,872
I will find him,

39
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:22,040
and there is nothing he

40
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:25,744
or anyone else can do to stop me now.

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,014
Nothing.

42
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:49,421
- What'll it be?
- Looking for Mick Lester.

43
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,090
- He ain't here.
- I heard he hangs out back.

44
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,327
You heard wrong.

45
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,319
I heard right.

46
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,472
You wanna know how I know that?

47
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:03,323
'Cause Carlos Mejia told me.

48
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,683
Carlos Mejia told you what?

49
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:08,319
- Put that thing down.
- Have a seat.

50
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,614
You make him a boatload of
cash moving his product.

51
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,216
What do you want?

52
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,614
Who would he contact to get
over the border into Mexico?

53
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,787
- He has people.
- Who he's not gonna go to

54
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:19,719
- because he gave them all up.
- You saying he's a rat?

55
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,178
- Then he's a dead man.
- Not if he gets across the border.

56
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,250
He runs all of his southwestern
shipment through you.

57
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,456
So who else does he know
down here in Texas?

58
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,305
This image is from an
FBI surveillance camera

59
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:37,449
- almost an hour ago.
- What's he doing in Texas?

60
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,680
He's trying to stop Mejia
from crossing the border.

61
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,284
You sent him down there?

62
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,853
We've been watching that place

63
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,855
ever since Mejia gave
up Lester last month.

64
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,658
Rein him in before he ruins
any more of our operations.

65
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:57,784
What's the priority here? Finding
Mejia and the hostage or

66
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:00,361
busting some mid-level dealer?

67
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:01,699
Not the point.

68
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:04,635
Our interests are the same as yours.

69
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,704
If Bryan can bring us
any closer to Mejia...

70
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:09,688
He's a loose canon and he's done,
so tie him down before I do.

71
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:12,176
You people are finished with Mejia.

72
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,011
This is an FBI operation now.

73
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,313
That's not your decision to make.

74
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:17,874
It's a direct order.

75
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,536
From the White House.

76
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,079
He runs all of his southwestern
shipment through you.

77
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,734
So who else does he know
down here in Texas?

78
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,669
Friends? Relatives?

79
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,915
His ex-wife. But she doesn't...

80
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,435
Alicia Mejia?

81
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,818
She's dead.

82
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,213
- Isn't she?
- Come on, man, give me a break.

83
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,269
You said they're watching me.

84
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,256
Roll it back.

85
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,427
His ex-wife.

86
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:04,594
- But she doesn't...
- Alicia Mejia?

87
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,263
She's dead. Isn't she?

88
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:08,237
Mejia's wife is alive.

89
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:11,069
- The guy just admitted as much.
- That's impossible.

90
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,431
She killed herself after Bryan shot
their son. We have it all on file.

91
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:17,408
El Paso PD autopsy report, huge funeral.

92
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:20,344
Totally credible narrative
with no questions asked.

93
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:23,247
Just another casualty
of the war on drugs.

94
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:25,215
Smart. Simple.

95
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,251
Bryan's on his way to El Paso.

96
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:28,492
He's gotta be.

97
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:30,464
- Where is he now?
- Angleton, Texas.

98
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:32,787
- How far to El Paso?
- It's about a five-hour drive.

99
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:35,242
Standby with the jet. Find the wife.

100
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,491
Mr. Mills?

101
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,967
You killed my son, Mr. Mills.

102
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:08,282
Yes, I did.

103
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,962
What can you possibly have to say to me?

104
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:14,265
- Your husband...
- Ex-husband.

105
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:16,734
I know what he is.

106
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:18,068
Who he is.

107
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:21,105
And just how long did
it take you to see that?

108
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,553
What do you want?

109
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:27,500
Your husband is on the run.

110
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,282
He's trying to get across to Mexico,

111
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,917
but his network's broken.

112
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:34,652
He can no longer trust his own people.

113
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:36,787
And you think I still want to help him?

114
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:39,426
I think you might not have a choice.

115
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,293
What can he do to me?

116
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:45,262
Without you, these
children have no hope.

117
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:47,443
I see.

118
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,686
You are the lesser
of two evil. Is that it?

119
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:53,649
If you can smuggle
children across the border,

120
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:56,314
then you can send him back the same way.

121
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:59,568
Does he know how you do it?

122
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:07,017
You want me to help you?

123
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,186
The man who murdered my son?

124
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,397
Because he has a hostage.

125
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:14,457
And she is innocent.

126
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:17,288
Like the children.

127
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:20,164
I'll pray for her.

128
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:23,200
If praying were the answer,
you would be doing what you do.

129
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,073
You have to understand.

130
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,866
This country is the only chance

131
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:33,818
these children have for a life.

132
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,565
Found him.

133
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,396
- Damn it.
- Bryan.

134
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:51,542
Bryan, this is an FBI operation now.

135
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:54,028
- We need to go home.
- Home?

136
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:56,146
- I'm not going home.
- I'm not gonna sanction

137
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:57,815
a suicide mission.

138
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:00,918
You going down there on your own
is not gonna save Asha Flynn,

139
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:03,387
and it's not gonna be an end to Mejia.

140
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:05,739
It's just going to be the loss

141
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:08,674
of one good man for nothing.

142
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:14,122
And no one here is going to
standby and let that happen.

143
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:17,401
Like it or not, you are
too important to us all now

144
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:22,058
and to what we do, and I'm not
going to debate this with you.

145
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,379
Come on.

146
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:33,584
Come on, the car is out front.

147
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,875
Damn it, Bryan.

148
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:47,501
I'm on it, try to cut him off.

149
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,819
What the hell? You okay?

150
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:03,747
- You just ran in front of my car.
- Sorry, man.

151
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,566
Hey. Hey! You son of a...

152
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:40,217
What do you think he will do now?

153
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:42,386
Your Bryan Mills?

154
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:48,259
I'll tell you what he's going to do.

155
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:50,947
He's going to play
directly into my hands

156
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:55,633
in Mexico where I have the advantage

157
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:59,236
because I control everybody

158
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:02,273
from the army to the police.

159
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:06,520
He will come for you.

160
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,661
Let him come.

161
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:13,671
Please.

162
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:18,589
Esta bien.

163
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:31,268
- Hola.
- Hola.

164
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:32,636
Senor.

165
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,951
Muy bien?

166
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:56,327
Bueno.

167
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,319
Go ahead. Do it.

168
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:27,254
Pull the trigger.

169
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:29,988
Then what?

170
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,838
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

171
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:42,312
Come on.

172
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:44,550
Come on.

173
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:47,937
No.

174
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:49,921
No.

175
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:08,265
Go!

176
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:21,378
Go!

177
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:42,467
Put your weapons down.

178
00:13:58,984 --> 00:14:01,900
You stay behind. Make sure
nobody else comes through.

179
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,376
Okay.

180
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:38,414
Welcome to Mexico.

181
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,856
Hey, hey, hey.

182
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,586
We come in peace.

183
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:58,042
- I'm not going back.
- Who's that?

184
00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:00,742
We never met.

185
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:04,307
- Did you hear what I just said?
- About going back?

186
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,009
Yeah. Funny.

187
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:07,540
- Easy now.
- I can't.

188
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,501
You don't have a choice.

189
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:13,816
They're right there on the
other side of that tunnel.

190
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:16,352
Every minute we wait, we waste.

191
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:19,055
- So let me go.
- We can't do that.

192
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,733
So another innocent person will die,

193
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,594
and Mejia wins again.

194
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:27,166
Is that really who we are?

195
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,452
'Cause if so, I quit.

196
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:34,037
You're... You're damn
right I don't have a choice.

197
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:36,873
Look, I know this all started
because of me, so I won't

198
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:39,914
think less of anyone of you if
you choose not to come do this,

199
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:42,827
but you are not stopping
me, and you know it.

200
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:45,348
So you go ahead.

201
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,784
Make your choice.

202
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:55,725
You're some pain in the
ass, you know that?

203
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:35,832
- Stop!
- They're taking her.

204
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:37,767
She's alive. Think.

205
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:40,684
- We're outgunned and outnumbered.
- Buddy, if she's alive now,

206
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,772
he doesn't want her dead.

207
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:44,224
Yet.

208
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:02,425
Hart.

209
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,365
We're with him now.

210
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:08,164
- You're on the way back?
- We went the other way.

211
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:10,871
- Excuse me?
- We need your help.

212
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:13,770
Your mission was to bring him in,

213
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:16,267
- not to go to Mexico.
- Give me the phone.

214
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:18,933
Thanks John.

215
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:20,977
That day when you recruited me,

216
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:22,429
- you remember that?
- Bryan...

217
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:24,982
You gave me that whole speech
about what I was born to do.

218
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:27,044
- This is different.
- How?

219
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:32,486
Yeah, that's what I thought.

220
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:34,824
I'll quit if I have to quit.

221
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:37,337
You can order the
others back, but not me.

222
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:42,511
Put John back on the phone.

223
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,491
- Yeah?
- Are you with him on this?

224
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:52,008
We all are.

225
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:54,310
- Send Dave back.
- We're all committed full...

226
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,702
I want him to meet me in
Juarez. I'm coming down.

227
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:00,249
Come on, come on,
guys. Got anything yet?

228
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:02,151
We've got coverage of
the six known properties

229
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:03,794
owned by Carlos Mejia.

230
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:06,115
One of them is showing
significant activity.

231
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,788
Let's go with that one. Call Hart.

232
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:36,018
Hey, Carlos!

233
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:44,293
- Look at you.
- And you.

234
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:48,397
This is Roderigo Acosta,
my right-hand man,

235
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:51,367
who I have trusted with
everything while I've been away.

236
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:54,537
I think you'll be pleased.
Business is booming.

237
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:57,373
Gracias a Dios.

238
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:02,545
It's good to be among family again.

239
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:10,660
Look after our guest.
Make her comfortable.

240
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,322
Make sure you position
her in plain sight.

241
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,765
I think it's going to
be an eventful night.

242
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:27,336
Special Agent Salt.

243
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:29,438
Can we make this quick, please?

244
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,609
Thanks for coming.

245
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:37,513
I know Martello's running a
couple undercover ops in Mexico.

246
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:40,516
Wait, no, sorry. I can't
discuss any of that.

247
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:43,019
Let me put it this way.

248
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:46,255
Bryan Mills needs help, you owe him.

249
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:51,175
- Where is he?
- Juarez.

250
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:53,079
He needs firepower.

251
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:59,832
There's a machine shop
on Calle Colombia.

252
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:03,873
You did not get this from me,
and I need your word on that.

253
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:06,175
I understand the drill.

254
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:24,719
That won't be necessary.

255
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:28,422
- Easy, easy now.
- Whoa.

256
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,090
If you'll allow him.

257
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:36,446
Lower your gun, please.

258
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:39,930
Tell them to leave. We've got business.

259
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:49,511
- What's going on? Why are you here?
- Need a favor.

260
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:52,765
Listen, lady, I don't know
who told you what, but this...

261
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,806
Is an FBI undercover
operation. Yes, we're aware.

262
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:59,395
And we know FBI has no
authority to be here.

263
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:03,051
So what do you want?

264
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,898
Everything.

265
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,260
Pleasure doing business with you.

266
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,777
Hey, amigo!

267
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,367
Sierra, this is Alpha. Moving
to the back entrance.

268
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,153
Entering the house.

269
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:58,072
We have a problem.
We're picking up movement

270
00:23:58,192 --> 00:24:00,661
of a Mexican military unit
on the move to Mejia's compound.

271
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:02,907
I need you to get the
ambassador on the phone.

272
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,057
Make sure they know we've
got agents in the house.

273
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,011
We need rules of engagement.

274
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,674
- Boy.
- Got it.

275
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:11,015
Keep an eye on the road
around the compound.

276
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,417
The second you see any
movement, I need to know.

277
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,268
You will. We have eyes.

278
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,298
We have eyes on Mejia...

279
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,492
And Asha.

280
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:13,371
I see you're taken
with our lovely guest.

281
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:16,806
You want your friends to think
you kept her safe from me.

282
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:20,336
Tell me you're not working
with the Americans.

283
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:23,445
- What're you talking about?
- You think I'm a fool?

284
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:27,112
They just penetrated the
compound a little too easily.

285
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,552
Two men are dead.

286
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,736
I've heard the rumors.

287
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,539
They're saying I'm un chivato.

288
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,874
That I don't have the
right to take my place

289
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,744
at the head of my business again.

290
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,746
That I betrayed my friends.

291
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,659
I would never...

292
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:47,085
And then you get to keep
all the profits for yourself.

293
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,788
You said it.

294
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,222
You want to retire.

295
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:54,926
Well, tonight, my friend,
is a night of reckoning

296
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,861
where I take care of all my enemies.

297
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,230
What are you saying?
Carlo... Carlos! Carlos!

298
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,104
Get the picture now?

299
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,867
Your Bryan Mills created all of this.

300
00:30:09,987 --> 00:30:12,743
It is because of him that
all these people here

301
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,722
have become liars and traitors.

302
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:24,222
This is what happens when you betray me.

303
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,458
Get out!

304
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,893
Get out of my house now!

305
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,123
Asha.

306
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,100
- We're gonna need back up.
- On our way.

307
00:30:52,473 --> 00:30:53,840
Stop.

308
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:18,222
I got him, go!

309
00:31:31,574 --> 00:31:34,380
No, no.

310
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,762
The Mexican military are coming.

311
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:42,782
- How long?
- Maybe five minutes.

312
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:45,053
- The ambassador is aware.
- I'm on the southwest

313
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:46,842
corner of the compound.

314
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:48,751
- Now I need access.
- To the compound?

315
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:51,423
The ambassador has to make sure
that I've got a military escort.

316
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,350
- I've gotta protect my men.
- Copy.

317
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,079
- Make it happen.
- Copy that.

318
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,753
And make it clear I want the
team out of there alive.

319
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:00,317
Once they are out, there
is no turning back.

320
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,652
Be sure they know that that's an order.

321
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:04,227
Mejia!

322
00:32:04,347 --> 00:32:05,799
It's over.

323
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,751
Let her go.

324
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,670
Me or her. Make a choice.

325
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,056
- You're all right. No, quiet.
- Bry...

326
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:27,075
- Kill him. Go.
- Shh, I got you.

327
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,506
Got a text from the boss.
We're out of here. Now.

328
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:36,287
We're moving out. You first.

329
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,576
Cover the exfil. Quickest
route. Single shots only.

330
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:40,765
Standby. On my signal.

331
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,376
No. No, no, no. No, you don't give up.

332
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,717
Whatever happens, you have to fight.

333
00:32:46,837 --> 00:32:48,398
You have to live.

334
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:56,140
He will never hurt you
again, I promise you that.

335
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,658
- Don't you let her go.
- Come with us.

336
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,775
- Mejia can wait.
- No.

337
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:03,547
This ends now.

338
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,653
Move now. Back way. We're clear.

339
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:11,539
Copy. I'm on my way.

340
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,264
They need a medevac helo now.

341
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,765
On it.

342
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,701
There's an entire regiment
of Mexican soldiers

343
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,846
- surrounding the place.
- Are they out of there?

344
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:27,571
Not yet. Not all of 'em.

345
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,740
Guess who's still in there?

346
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,577
Put your weapon down.

347
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,637
Bryan,

348
00:33:52,757 --> 00:33:55,795
drop your weapon.
That is a direct order.

349
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,386
Medevac's inbound.
We're two minutes out.

350
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,474
Focus on me.

351
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,765
Help is on the way. Just stay with us.

352
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,214
Here comes a bird.

353
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,151
I'm gonna be with you all the way, okay?

354
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:18,155
Easy now.

355
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,790
Put your weapon down

356
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,659
and raise your hands up

357
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,532
or you will be shot!

358
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,569
Bryan, this is your last chance.

359
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,468
They will take you down.

360
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,177
There is nothing I
can do about it. Bryan!

361
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,393
I surrender.

362
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,301
Good-bye.

363
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,922
No!

364
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:13,692
Secure the area.

365
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,376
Stand down. Move.

366
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:23,768
Move back! Move back!

367
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,239
- Let me through.
- Stay back.

368
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,912
- Let me through.
- Stay back.

369
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,565
Let me pass. He's a
U.S. government agent.

370
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,301
Stand down. Move back.

371
00:35:38,282 --> 00:35:40,266
Move back! Stand down.

372
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:42,154
Stand down. He's ours now.

373
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,268
I'm sorry about Bryan Mills.

374
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,524
Okay. You want the truth?

375
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:09,079
Your people got in the way of
a Mexican government operation.

376
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:11,348
That you called in when
you thought we'd succeeded

377
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:13,357
- where you had failed.
- It was the right move.

378
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:15,967
And I happen to know the Security
Council will see it that way.

379
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,522
Your man made a mockery
of international law.

380
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:21,765
To save a hostage. To
rid the world of a monster.

381
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:24,061
So you approve of what he did?

382
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:25,647
I admire it.

383
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:28,852
And so should you.

384
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,580
You know that operation
you had going on in Juarez?

385
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,939
Setting up an agent to sell arms

386
00:36:35,973 --> 00:36:38,369
to a cartel rival of Mejia's?

387
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:41,941
You have no proof of that.

388
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,415
Let's see what that excuse gets you

389
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,625
when I bring it up to
the Security Council.

390
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:51,930
Talk about breaking international law.

391
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:54,943
What do you want from me?

392
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:56,960
I want you to beat every bush

393
00:36:56,994 --> 00:37:00,216
- and turn over every stone in Mexico.
- For Mills?

394
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:02,350
You think he's still alive.

395
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:13,051
If not, I want his body back.

396
00:37:31,696 --> 00:37:33,359
What do we hear?

397
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:37,467
Boss talked to the Mexican ambassador.

398
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:39,178
Said he doesn't know anything.

399
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,476
Yeah, nobody knows nothing.

400
00:37:41,596 --> 00:37:44,441
- Figures.
- What about their military?

401
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:46,476
Our military?

402
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:48,078
They got nothing to say?

403
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:49,780
Radio silence.

404
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:51,322
He's just...

405
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:02,426
What happened at the SSC?

406
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,384
Are they looking for Bryan?

407
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:10,267
They don't wanna even acknowledge him.

408
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:12,602
They just want the whole
thing to go away.

409
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:13,893
So what,

410
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:16,132
- didn't happen?
- It wouldn't be the first time.

411
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,141
- You all know that.
- He could be alive.

412
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:21,178
We should have gone back right then.

413
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:27,050
- We made the wrong call.
- I made the call.

414
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:28,285
It's on me.

415
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,120
We all know how this works.

416
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,788
I could have lost all of you,

417
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:34,191
and that would have been unacceptable.

418
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:37,427
You weren't going back in there.

419
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:42,644
Bryan would have gone.

420
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:52,699
Yes.

421
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:55,191
Yes, he would have.

422
