2
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:41,255
- Stupid changeling.
- Think fast!

3
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:43,966
Get out the trash.

4
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:48,763
Only an Impure would be stupid
enough to raise Angor Rot.

5
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:51,140
Gunmar can't save him now.

6
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:53,517
Not so tough without
your assassin, are ye?

7
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:55,352
- Guilty changeling!
- Fire!

8
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:57,813
- You throw like a sloth-kin.
- Stupid changeling.

9
00:00:57,814 --> 00:01:01,025
Let's get him down from there
and really have some fun.

10
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:06,489
Jim? Jim! James Lake Junior!

11
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,118
She allowed Angor Rot
to obtain a Horngazel.

12
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,705
The very key past
Trollmarket's defenses?

13
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:17,166
It's not Claire's fault, it's mine.

14
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:19,543
I should've gone to the
school for the incantation.

15
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:22,755
I should've faced Angor Rot. Not them.

16
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:26,133
It was in my purse. Toby and
I were dangling off the roof.

17
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:27,551
He cut it off and left.

18
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,595
It was a great everyday
purse. It went with everything.

19
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:33,849
We might have time. Angor Rot
rarely attacks during the day...

20
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,976
Angor Rot is unpredictable at best.

21
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:40,481
And if there isn't anything to stop him
from creating havoc in Trollmarket...

22
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:44,735
then you have just put more
than yourselves at risk.

23
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:47,361
Trollhunter! Help!

24
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:50,199
- Get out of our way, Aaarrrgghh!!!
- No.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,451
Let us discuss this matter
like reasonable trolls!

26
00:01:52,452 --> 00:01:55,171
Ruffians! Who threw that?

27
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:57,779
Where's Jim? He gave me his word!

28
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,669
Put him down! He helped save my mother.

29
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,297
- He's with me.
- He tried to release Gunmar!

30
00:02:05,298 --> 00:02:06,880
Get him out of here!

31
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:09,420
Changelings ain't right in Trollmarket!

32
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,469
Get rid of him!

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,473
It's not going to make a
difference. Angor Rot wants me too,

34
00:02:14,474 --> 00:02:16,892
and the protective
barrier won't stop him.

35
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:18,069
Hmm.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,605
- What do you mean?
- He has a Horngazel.

37
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:25,109
Look, you have a right to know!

38
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,111
Let's throw them both out!

39
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:29,405
It's time the amulet calls for another!

40
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:31,198
- Jimbo!
- It's not his fault!

41
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,242
- Throw them out!
- Throw them out!

42
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:36,412
- When you finish throwing them out...
- What's he doing?

43
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:39,456
... come back and throw me out, too.

44
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:42,084
Yes, the boy has made grave errors.

45
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:46,714
But he's come through for us more
times than I give him credit for.

46
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:49,174
Trollmarket is in danger...

47
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:52,595
and our greatest defense has
always been our Trollhunter.

48
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:56,307
He's earned my trust. He
should have earned yours.

49
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:59,602
- You can throw me out, too!
- And me.

50
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:02,897
Us too, though technically,
we don't live here.

51
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:05,149
- I'm just sayin'.
- Same for me.

52
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,527
I've always stood with our Trollhunter.

53
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,413
Okay, yeah.

54
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:14,263
- I have to admit, it's true.
- Mm.

55
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:19,214
What now, our infallible leader?

56
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,544
Now, we get ready to give Angor Rot...

57
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:27,713
the fight of his life!

58
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:37,899
- Pile them as high as you can!
- More gnomes!

59
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:43,020
Don't worry, just stay indoors.
Not everyone has to fight.

60
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:47,900
Whatever.

61
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:50,986
- Toby, we have to tell Jim.
- Tell me what?

62
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:54,698
Tell who what? Nothing to see here.

63
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,618
Chompsky? No way! When did he get out?

64
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:01,080
A little while ago.
We were gonna tell you,

65
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:02,706
but with everything and your mom...

66
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:06,335
Why would you hold back the great
news? He escaped the Darklands!

67
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:09,421
Uh, technically, he didn't.

68
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:13,217
Gunmar let him out to deliver a message.

69
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:16,011
Jim, Gunmar knows you killed his son.

70
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:18,555
And he promises to make a river...

71
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:22,518
no, an ocean of blood
from your loved ones.

72
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,687
And he's gonna make a throne.

73
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:28,283
with their... I think he said bones.

74
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,568
His words. Not mine.

75
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:35,114
And... and he included a list.

76
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:40,577
Tobias. Claire. Barbara. Blinkous.

77
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:43,706
We knew what we were getting
into. After we find the last stone,

78
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:46,208
we'll find my brother and
end this once and for all.

79
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:47,710
Draal. Coach Lawrence.

80
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:50,879
It goes on for a while. You
don't need to listen to this.

81
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,799
It's like you said, we shouldn't
be focused on the fight tomorrow

82
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,009
but the fight today.

83
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,720
It's too bad we've been wasting our
time collecting stones to kill Gunmar

84
00:04:57,721 --> 00:04:58,887
and not Angor Rot.

85
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:00,565
Or so you think.

86
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:07,447
Maybe you do have a stone. Angor's eye.

87
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:11,567
You're saying I can
use this in my amulet?

88
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,402
Jim, you're gonna level up again!

89
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:18,458
- If cut with the proper guidance.
- Show me where to cut.

90
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:28,292
Unlock its dark power, and you'll
be able to ward off his magics.

91
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:31,763
Cleave here, ever so gently.

92
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:47,153
Ah-ha!

93
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,024
Stubborn hammer!

94
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:54,651
We're supposed to be on the same team!

95
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:56,403
Ah!

96
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:57,705
Uh!

97
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:00,657
Follow that facet there.

98
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:04,661
Careful now, you only
have one chance at this.

99
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:08,123
Angor Rot? What's that
old fossil gonna do?

100
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:10,793
There's three of us and one of him.

101
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:13,045
I'm gonna break him over
my knee. Back breaker!

102
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:19,384
And then when he's trying
to get up, power bomb! Boom!

103
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:21,178
And then he's like, "No,
stop!" I'll be like...

104
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:30,613
I am not afraid of death, Father.

105
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:35,159
For in the afterlife,
I shall see you again.

106
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:49,206
Are you sure there isn't
anything more I can do?

107
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:52,835
The other trolls don't
trust fighting alongside you.

108
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:55,504
And honestly, neither do I.

109
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:59,049
You kept your word. And
after everything I've done.

110
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,845
Once again, you've proved why you are...

111
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:05,639
the hero, and I am...

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,477
- Someone who can change.
- Your idealism is nearly contagious.

113
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,858
- My gratitude cannot be enough.
- Gee, a friendship rock?

114
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:20,779
After you're done with Angor's eye,
I thought you could use Gunmar's.

115
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,907
You need the last Triumbric
stone to defeat Gunmar.

116
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:26,994
I've been holding onto it for centuries.

117
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:30,899
I kept it close in case you drove
a hard bargain to protect me.

118
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,542
But if I kill Gunmar...

119
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:37,629
Save the children? Yes,
if you rescue my familiar,

120
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,716
then I'll be trapped in
my troll form forever.

121
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:43,552
But there's nothing left
for me in the human world.

122
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:46,054
It's not like I'll ever
have a future with your mo...

123
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:47,556
Don't.

124
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:51,569
- I have overstayed my welcome.
- Thank you.

125
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:54,688
You may not believe me, Young Atlas...

126
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,775
but I do wish you luck and
hope we meet again one day.

127
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:00,536
Goodbye, Mr. Strickler.

128
00:08:15,543 --> 00:08:18,971
Hurry! Protect yourselves! Everyone!

129
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:24,635
Is he knocking? Is that some
sort of troll war etiquette?

130
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:27,221
I believe he's attempting
to intimidate us.

131
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:31,099
He's expecting us to hide. I
say we take the fight to him.

132
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,895
Draal, hold the stairs. Blink,
Claire, Tobes, protect Trollmarket.

133
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:39,233
- Aaarrrgghh!!!, Not Enrique, with me.
- I'm rather comfy where I am.

134
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,120
Ya brute!

135
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,547
Huh?

136
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:57,969
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

137
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:04,934
We're not letting him past
us! What the... Watch out!

138
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:14,476
Wowza, big guy, let's keep
it PG. Where's Angor Rot?

139
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:18,105
It's a diversion! He must
be coming in another way!

140
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:20,658
- Other way?
- The Gyre Station!

141
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,627
What happened? Where's Angor Rot?

142
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:46,475
- There he is! Let's do this, boys!
- Back breaker!

143
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:54,141
Power bomb?

144
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:55,976
- Angor!
- Hmm?

145
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:59,605
Trollhunter, I have some
friends I'd like you to meet.

146
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:04,327
- What's that noise?
- It's an earthquake!

147
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:20,217
You handle Angor. We got this.

148
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,402
There's so many of them!

149
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:49,455
When will you learn that
Daylight is mine to command?

150
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,543
No!

151
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,289
Guess I should thank you
for giving me the stink-eye.

152
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,550
My eye!

153
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:09,475
- Shh!
- Huh?

154
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:32,739
Feel the wrath of the Warhammer!

155
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,959
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

156
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:39,422
Watch out!

157
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,041
Uh...

158
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,793
Oops! Sorry!

159
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:47,596
No!

160
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,842
Excellent work, pudgebag.

161
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:59,775
Oy! No one lays a hand
on my sister! Ya brute!

162
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:09,452
- You saved my life, bro.
- Let's not get sentimental.

163
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:13,864
You destroyed my soul, Hunter...

164
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:16,658
now I shall harvest yours!

165
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:20,412
Oh, I enjoy this horn!

166
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:23,874
It's not "Hunter," Angor.

167
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,969
- It's "Hunters"!
- Eat chrome!

168
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,753
Got him!

169
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:32,132
I drove! Did you see? I
drove a human automobile!

170
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:33,726
What a thrill!

171
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:36,645
Blinky.

172
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:41,609
Out of the way! Out
of the way! Incoming!

173
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,105
You thought I could be
defeated that easily?

174
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:51,452
That your human
contraption could kill me?

175
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:56,823
Where are they all coming from?

176
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:59,284
We're surrounded!

177
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:00,911
There's too many of them!

178
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:08,052
Aaarrrgghh!!! We require your strength!

179
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:16,060
No! Stop it! Please, don't!

180
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:26,862
Toby!

181
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:40,584
No!

182
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:43,963
Aaarrrgghh!!!

183
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:50,544
- Aaarrrgghh!!!?
- Wingman.

184
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:51,545
Aaarrrgghh!!!

185
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:56,308
- We are still in battle.
- Aaarrrgghh!!!

186
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,435
Oh, no.

187
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:07,060
I'm going to kill you!

188
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:18,196
I destroyed your soul! Your
fight is with me! Not them!

189
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:20,499
As you wish, Trollhunter.

190
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:46,233
Clever Hunter!

191
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,867
Just you and me now.

192
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:11,082
The Hero's Forge.

193
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,169
More like a coward's grave.

194
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,983
Enough of your games.

195
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:53,375
Do you ever wonder how
you've lived this long?

196
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:56,220
- Master Jim!
- No! Let us in!

197
00:15:58,172 --> 00:15:59,839
The only reason you're alive

198
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,885
is because you've let your
loved ones fall in your place!

199
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:07,973
Your teacher, the
changeling! Your mother!

200
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:09,766
No! Jim!

201
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:15,063
And now your simple friend,
Aaarrrgghh!!!, is dead!

202
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:16,782
No!

203
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,280
But where are your
loved ones now, Hunter?

204
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:25,949
Up here, Rot Head!

205
00:16:55,938 --> 00:16:57,781
Angor Rot is defeated!

206
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:03,078
Trollmarket is protected once again!

207
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:16,675
Jim!

208
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:24,591
- Is he really gone?
- He better be.

209
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:26,685
Yeah. He better be.

210
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:33,099
- Finally.
- Our souls are free.

211
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,195
We return to our brethren.

212
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:44,652
What... I mean, who are they?

213
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:49,282
These are the spirits
of our fallen brethren.

214
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:54,412
Trollhunters who lost both
soul and life to Angor Rot.

215
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:58,792
Our brothers and sisters shall
take their proper place in the void

216
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:00,919
and rest in peace.

217
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,381
Thanks to you, James Lake
Junior, and your friends.

218
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:09,344
You were right, you
are stronger together.

219
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:11,346
We are in your debt.

220
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:14,891
But the day will come, Trollhunter,

221
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:18,487
when you must finish the fight alone.

222
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:21,231
Father?

223
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:27,153
My son, I am so sorry
for pushing you away.

224
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:30,573
I am so proud of you.

225
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:32,167
Father.

226
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,129
Father. Father!

227
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,582
Return to our brethren.

228
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,876
Our souls are free!

229
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:12,207
Toby, hold onto that anger.
Save it for the Darklands.

230
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,549
Jim.

231
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:26,838
In darkest tide, when
Daylight darest wane...

232
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:31,509
the Myrddin Wylt
obscured a shadow's bane.

233
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,681
Three forces elemental thou must seek.

234
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:41,394
In marshland, caverns
deep and mountain's peak.

235
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:45,607
Where worthy perish,
ye'll prevail in night.

236
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:49,611
And eclipse all who
quarry with thy might.

237
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:55,626
For the doom of Gunmar,
Eclipse is mine to command!

238
00:20:31,654 --> 00:20:33,497
Master Jim!

239
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:39,086
Dude, what are you doing? Jim, don't!

240
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:43,248
Jim, no! You promised we'd go together!

241
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:48,011
The amulet chose me. I
can't lose any more of you.

242
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,560
Maybe I can manually override the lock.

243
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,786
Whoa.

244
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:18,533
Come on, Jimbo! We're
a team! Don't do this!

245
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:22,328
I'm sorry. I have to finish the fight.

246
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:23,630
Alone.

247
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:28,093
But the amulet chose me.

248
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,173
- Jim!
- I'm sorry.

249
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:36,602
No! Jim!

250
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:43,182
Jim!

251
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:46,278
Master Jim, what have you done?

252
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:02,169
Get ready, Gunmar.

253
