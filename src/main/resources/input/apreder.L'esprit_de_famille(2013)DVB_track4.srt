1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,760
A SENSE OF FAMILY

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,720
I did warn you, Hélène.

3
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,440
You can't have dialysis forever.

4
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,880
There's only one solution:

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,480
a transplant.

6
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,080
You mentioned a brother?

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,040
Two. I have two brothers.

8
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,440
That's even better.

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,960
Are they healthy?
Do you get on well?

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,160
Yes, of course, but...

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
It isn't a good idea.

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,320
- What time do I start?
- 7am.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
Fuck! 7am...

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,640
- That's very, very early.
- Yes.

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,240
It won't be easy.
I'm not a morning person.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,640
7am is the time
I usually go to bed.

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,800
I see. Sorry to remind you,

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,640
Mr Lopez, but...
- Perez.

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,480
You have no qualifications.

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,640
No high school diploma.

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,640
It was deliberate.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,240
Or I'd have ended a teacher,
like the rest of the family.

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,760
I was dead bored at school.
No way am I going back!

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,080
Right.

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,800
What would you really like to do?

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,360
Write.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,880
Writer, novelist,

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,200
songwriter,
anything to do with writing.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,800
That's great, but publishers
looking for manuscripts

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
rarely call us.

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,720
You're taking the piss!

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,360
- It is my turn.
- Yes!

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,480
I understand.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,640
OK. Right, well, I...
I'll go then.

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,480
No. Mr Perez, I'm certain.
It isn't skin cancer.

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,240
- Shouldn't it be removed?
- Honestly, it isn't necessary.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,680
If it's removed,
will it be analysed?

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,360
Yes. Always.

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,800
But why analyse it
if it isn't cancer?

40
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,680
It's the rule.
One never knows.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,680
- You're not 100% sure.
- Yes, I am 100% sure.

42
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,440
Don't contradict yourself!

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,080
If you're sure, you bin it.
Let's not bankrupt the system.

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,080
- Because you aren't?
- I contribute.

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Mr Perez,

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,680
you have consulted me 4 times
for insignificant spots.

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,760
The last time it was a blue spot,
which turned out to be ink.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Right, I'll go.
How much do I owe you?

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,520
Nothing.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,240
I don't dare ask
Yvan and Max myself.

51
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
I'm not up

52
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,920
to calling them.
- I'll tell them.

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,960
- They'll feel they have to.
- Look, darling,

54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
they'll agree because
they're your brothers

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,960
and it's the only solution.
Your dad and I are sure.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,400
But there's Alice too.

57
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,640
They're married.
They have to decide together.

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
Maybe Yvan will agree, but her?

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,400
OK. I'll talk

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,680
to Alice too.
Just stop thinking about it.

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,400
OK, my love?
Come on, be brave.

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,320
Love you. See you soon.

63
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,760
Alright, children, listen to me!

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,760
Nassim! Stop, Nassim.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,040
Come on, stop!

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,960
Right...

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,960
I'll start again.

68
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,680
Thank you!

69
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,600
Thanks for waiting quietly.

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,240
We're going to discuss
a great French author.

71
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,520
Look and listen.

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Voltaire.

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Get out your books.

74
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,680
Hey!

75
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,240
Awesome, huh?

76
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,120
And... did he read it?

77
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
He read it.

78
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,680
And?

79
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,360
Right.

80
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,400
I thought it wasn't great.
He thought it was crap.

81
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,360
Hey, honey,
give me Max's lyrics.

82
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,840
"I'll take the plane or the boat,
even if I can't float."

83
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,480
- Fab!
- Powerful.

84
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,120
- Makes you want to travel, huh?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,240
"Our voices clash,
our bodies smash."

86
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,080
Sounds like you used a dictionary:
the pages with "SH".

87
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,520
You're saying it wrong.

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,960
Obviously, it sounds bad.

89
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,840
You're deliberately ignoring
the poetry of my lyrics.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,360
I was aiming for something between
Verlaine and Boby Lapointe.

91
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,360
That kind of thing.

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,200
The approach of a poet, basically.

93
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,680
Poet, right!
I don't need a poet.

94
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,640
I need a songwriter.

95
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,720
But I'm a songwriter too.

96
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,520
It's so annoying!

97
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,400
- I work for loads of singers.
- Which singers?

98
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,920
Look, that really isn't the point.

99
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,680
Either you like it or you don't.

100
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,960
Tell me.

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't talk about it.
For instance, Bénabar.

102
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Bénabar writes his own songs.

103
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,560
- No, some of them...
- Goodbye.

104
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,840
Yes, it's bright green.
Did you drink a mint cordial?

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,680
- Last night.
- It's the colouring.

106
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
Sir?

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,640
- Excuse me.
- That's OK.

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,400
- Temerene.
- Do you have a prescription?

109
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,240
- No.
- You need a prescription.

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,280
- Lexenan, then.
- For that too.

111
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,840
Apanyl?

112
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,960
If you want to sleep,
I have verbena.

113
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
- Are you new here?
- Why?

114
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,840
- I don't know you.
- I don't know you either.

115
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,720
Olivier, this is Yvan,

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,120
my husband.
Olivier Lebrun just arrived.

117
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,840
A pharmacy student.

118
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,400
Alice, do you sell drugs
without a prescription?

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,840
No, never.
Or just by accident.

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,560
Make sure such accidents
don't happen too often in the future.

121
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,400
- Why does he speak to you like that?
- He's the boss's son.

122
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Really? Shit!

123
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,680
I couldn't say so earlier.
He's got it in for me.

124
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,080
Why?

125
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,160
He tried chatting me up
and I ignored him.

126
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,840
But go easy on him!

127
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,160
Be nice to him.

128
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,680
So you can have your drugs?

129
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,240
No. But when a guy chats you up,
you can be...

130
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,160
See?

131
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,440
I'll sleep with him
so you can get your drugs for free!

132
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,960
You don't have to sleep with him!

133
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,280
Don't get carried away.
You could...

134
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,680
I don't know.
You could...

135
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,160
I could?

136
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,520
Kiss him.

137
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,560
Kiss him?

138
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,720
A peck.

139
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,560
- Are you serious?
- Only kidding.

140
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
What's the matter?

141
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,600
Yvan, you can kiss me.

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Give me a kiss!

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,280
- He knows you're my hubby.
- I don't care.

144
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Give me a kiss!

145
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,160
Hi.

146
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,280
- Your brother's here.
- Amazing!

147
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
- You look poorly.
- I went to bed late.

148
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,080
Thanks, Mum.

149
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,600
You're late.

150
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,560
Dad, it's Sunday.

151
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,680
2:10 pm. It's a new record!

152
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,280
You're taking the piss.

153
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,120
What is it? What's wrong?
Look at me.

154
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
Oh dear! Migraine,
tummy ache, and piles!

155
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
- Hi, Alice.
- Hey.

156
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,560
- Still together?
- I couldn't find better.

157
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,120
- You didn't look.
- We'll end up inviting you alone!

158
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,280
Stop moaning.

159
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,840
What's up?

160
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,520
- Sorry to disagree with you.
- You never agree.

161
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,560
It isn't the point.

162
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,560
We just stuff kids' heads with facts!

163
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,840
What would you know?
You got expelled three times!

164
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,960
Just because you're teacher...

165
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,040
Excuse me.
Could you listen to me?

166
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,840
Don't mention it.

167
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,160
We've something important
to tell you.

168
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,000
- It's your sister.
- Has she got worse?

169
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,680
- She's not improved.
- How is she?

170
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,840
The dialysis is wearing her out.

171
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,760
Her doctor has asked her

172
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,320
to think seriously
about a transplant.

173
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
I've always said she needed one!

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,680
She's on the waiting list.

175
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,880
- It could take years.
- There's another solution.

176
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,560
- A living donor.
- Of course.

177
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

178
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,280
Where will she find a living donor?

179
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
In her family.

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,280
- "Her family"?
- Her family.

181
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,840
And the only family she has
is us, obviously.

182
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,040
And you're too old.

183
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,840
Yes. Unfortunately.

184
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,280
- Who would it be then?
- You.

185
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,040
Me?

186
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,440
Or your brother.

187
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,400
- We give a kidney.
- It's a transplant.

188
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,480
It isn't a problem!

189
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,560
- I'm just saying that it's us.
- How will we decide?

190
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,400
We'll see which of you agrees.

191
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,600
If it's for Hélène, it's yes.
There's no need to think about it.

192
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,200
We'll even give her two,
if need be. Yvan?

193
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Er, yeah...

194
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,400
- There you go.
- Two.

195
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,400
And you, Alice?
You can have a say.

196
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,000
I, er... If Yvan agrees,

197
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,680
I agree.

198
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,600
Hang on, because I mean...
Is it a delicate operation?

199
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,720
- Could we die?
- No.

200
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,560
- Right, well, then.
- In theory, yes.

201
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,720
But in practice, medicine today...

202
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,120
When you're dead, that's it.
It's hard for those you leave.

203
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,840
- It's like for jerks, isn't it?
- Max!

204
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,200
We're not each giving her a kidney.

205
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,760
We agree on that.
So it's Yvan or me.

206
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
It has to be the healthiest.

207
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,880
Yvan, your results are perfect.

208
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,120
You're not a doctor!

209
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,760
I'm your wife. I know.

210
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,720
You have tests all the time!
We'd know if you were ill.

211
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,160
In any case, they check everything.

212
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,320
To donate a kidney,
if there's any problem at all,

213
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,560
you're eliminated.

214
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,200
I don't get it.

215
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
They could find something serious?

216
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,280
What kind of thing?

217
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
- I don't know.
- You look poorly.

218
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,280
- Maybe it's a blood clot!
- Don't pick on him.

219
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,200
I'd check.
You look a bit yellow.

220
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,400
Enough!

221
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Hélène is moving in next week.

222
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,400
She can't be on her own.

223
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,720
She's stopping work
and doing her dialysis in Paris.

224
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,160
Well, boys?

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,280
Do you agree?

226
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
She'll die otherwise.

227
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,280
Don't worry.
No one's going to die. Huh, Yvan?

228
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,280
- Shall I run you a bath?
- Not right now.

229
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,840
- What's that?
- A forum on transplants.

230
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,280
Forums are nonsense!

231
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,840
"I spent a week in hospital.

232
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,360
"It took me a month
to recover completely.

233
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,560
"Living with one kidney
is no problem whatsoever.

234
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,200
"You're not more tired.
You can lead a normal life."

235
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,080
I said yes right away,
without hesitating.

236
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,160
When it's about saving your sis,
you don't hesitate.

237
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,440
- That's so brave.
- Yes, I know.

238
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,000
Right. To donating organs!

239
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,160
Don't try to impress me
with your quotes.

240
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,000
Give me your emotions.

241
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,640
Be personal.

242
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,440
Benaroche,
aren't you working?

243
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,040
- I've finished, sir.
- What's that?

244
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,320
Show me your essay.

245
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
It's blank.

246
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
You've written nothing.

247
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,640
- I've nothing to say.
- About friendship?

248
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,280
It's a crap topic.

249
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,920
Think about it.
Draw on your personal experience.

250
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,200
Don't you have friends?

251
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,160
I don't want to write bullshit.
Give me a zero.

252
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,880
- I don't care!
- Well, I do.

253
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
When I put zero,
it's a personal failure.

254
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,320
- Give me a break.
- What's your problem?

255
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,040
I've got a problem
with people who do my head in.

256
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,000
I forbid you to leave.

257
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,040
Benaroche!

258
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,720
- Why do you want my car?
- To go to Lille

259
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,080
to get Hélène.

260
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,640
She's got a big case.
They won't send her

261
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,000
by ambulance.
- Why are you going?

262
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,000
I have the time.

263
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,880
I'm on top of my work.
I'll go then return your car.

264
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,000
Besides, you've got a scooter.

265
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,800
- I'm free tomorrow.
- Yvan, you don't like driving.

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,720
- Why not let him go?
- Hi, Alice.

267
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,240
How are you?
What's cooking tonight?

268
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
- Spaghetti. Coming?
- I can't.

269
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm not alone. Vanessa!

270
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,760
Come say hi.

271
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,000
My bro, Yvan.
His wife, Alice.

272
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,440
Hi, bro. Hi, Alice.

273
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Hey!

274
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,480
Tell your fiancée to get dressed.

275
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,960
Hey, we're at home!

276
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,200
Come off it!

277
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,960
"Your fiancée"!

278
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,320
You're so old-fashioned, you are!

279
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,160
I'll pick up the car tomorrow.

280
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,160
- Alright?
- Are you deaf?

281
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,720
I'll go. She's my sister too.

282
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,000
I never said she wasn't!

283
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,680
I'm saving you a trip,
and you shout at me.

284
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,880
It's true. You're right.
Come closer, Max.

285
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,160
And don't move.

286
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,480
Don't move.

287
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,160
That felt good!

288
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
Yeah, right!

289
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,720
Why don't you show up
completely starkers?

290
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,600
Shake your butt in his face!

291
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,800
What time did you say we'd be there?

292
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,960
I didn't.

293
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,400
- At this rate, it'll be tomorrow.
- I'm going at my pace.

294
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,240
Yeah, it shows.

295
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,280
You're going at your pace!

296
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
No way are you smoking!

297
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,600
- There's an ashtray.
- Yes, but you can't smoke.

298
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,040
- A non-smoking ashtray?
- Precisely!

299
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
What crap!

300
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,920
No, Max.

301
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,680
Don't drop your ash outside.
It blows back into the car.

302
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,800
- Put it out!
- Stop, Yvan.

303
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,160
Put it out, please, Max!

304
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,960
OK, OK!
You're a fucking tyrant!

305
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I can't not smoke
all the way to Lille!

306
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,400
If you'd said,
I'd have worn a patch.

307
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,880
Just quit. For the transplant,
they check your lungs.

308
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,080
Why are you hassling me?
I don't even smoke 10 a day.

309
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,880
For the transplant,
maybe they'll check your brain!

310
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,360
Even the lorries are overtaking us!

311
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,840
You drive too slowly.
70 is dangerous.

312
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,320
Come on.

313
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,000
Come on, Max!

314
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,080
Mind if I finish it?

315
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,920
I don't believe this.

316
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,480
Why didn't you go earlier?

317
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,120
I piss when I need to, not before.

318
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,200
Do you need a shit too?

319
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,080
What are you doing?

320
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm taking the wheel.

321
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,360
- You don't have your licence.
- I do. And I want to drive.

322
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,920
- Can't I drive the car?
- Show me your licence.

323
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,800
- I've got it. Let me drive.
- Get out!

324
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,360
Let me drive.
Hurry up, I'm going!

325
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,800
Go on. Be very careful.

326
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,480
Max! Stop!

327
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,560
Max. Max! Stop!

328
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
It's deliberate.

329
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,800
- What is?
- You're doing 140.

330
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,080
No, I'm not.

331
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm barely doing 135.

332
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,400
Your car needs to breathe.

333
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,360
Hear how happy she is.

334
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,160
Can you hear her purring?
She's loving it, for once!

335
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,840
Save your dumb euphemisms
for your bar buddies!

336
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,280
Now just slow down,

337
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,400
or I'll take the wheel right now.

338
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
What a pain in the ass!

339
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,680
What's up with you?
Have you got your period?

340
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,840
Slowly.

341
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,440
The police.

342
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Fuck, they're after us!

343
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,960
- Belt up!
- Stop.

344
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,320
OK, I'll pull over.

345
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,280
Belt up. Quick!

346
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,480
- Blow in here, sir.
- It's 8 in the morning.

347
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,520
- I didn't ask you the time.
- I had a coffee.

348
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
I didn't ask you what you drank.

349
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,760
Blow. Blow.

350
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,120
Zero.

351
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,600
Your MOT expired a week ago.

352
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,200
It isn't my car, it's his.

353
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,600
- Didn't you do your MOT?
- I couldn't.

354
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,520
His car is perfectly fine.
It drives well.

355
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,880
- You committed an offence.
- He did.

356
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,560
We'll forget about the speeding.

357
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,760
But I'll have to fine you
for having no MOT.

358
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,280
That'll be 135 euros.
If you pay now, it's 90.

359
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,720
We'll pay now.

360
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,200
- It's fifty-fifty.
- What? But it's your car.

361
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,120
It isn't for speeding.
It's your fault.

362
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,640
- The MOT is important, huh?
- Obviously.

363
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,920
You check the car before driving.

364
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,200
It's irresponsible not to!

365
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,680
Absolutely.
What happened, sir?

366
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,080
I'm not to blame.

367
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,280
Sis!

368
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,720
- OK?
- Was the drive alright?

369
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,480
My darling Linette,
you live so far away!

370
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,640
I thought I was going to be asked
for my passport.

371
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,480
- It's sweet to come pick me up.
- It's normal.

372
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
- Look.
- What's that?

373
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,760
We brought food.
There's a bit of everything.

374
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,400
Your place is so cute!

375
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,080
It's a girl's flat.
You can feel a woman's presence.

376
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,360
What are these photos?
Where did you get them?

377
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,840
They're old.
Didn't Mum give you the same?

378
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,160
No way. Mum doesn't love us.

379
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,320
- Tony Danza in Who's the Boss?
- That's true.

380
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,520
You do look like him.

381
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,800
Are you sure Dad isn't Tony Danza?

382
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,120
I wanted to say
that what you're doing for me...

383
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,440
But you can still think about it.

384
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,800
If you change your mind, it's OK.

385
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,120
Listen to me.

386
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,760
We have no intention
of changing our minds.

387
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,360
Just so it's clear.

388
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,480
Huh, Yvan?

389
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,480
Are you nuts?
What would we do without you?

390
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,880
Remember what
she used to sing before bed?

391
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,280
- "Before bed"?
- You were a boys band fan.

392
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,680
- It was only for 1 month.
- It went on for 2 years!

393
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,080
You had the posters.
She wanted to go to the concerts.

394
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,680
- She made us learn the lyrics!
- What was that about?

395
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
Talk about a crush!

396
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,000
- What was her morning song?
- I'm not helping you.

397
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,920
Leave one day
And never look back

398
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,720
When love goes away

399
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,720
You gotta change tack

400
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,120
Come and sit down.

401
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,440
Sit down.

402
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,720
We haven't changed a thing.

403
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,400
You could have.
I wouldn't have minded.

404
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,960
What did I tell you?

405
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,760
Your dad never wants
to change anything.

406
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,640
You're lucky.
Our room has become a box room.

407
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,040
It is too!

408
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,320
Shall I close the curtains?
Want to rest?

409
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,240
It's OK, Dad.
It's 3 in the afternoon.

410
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,680
- Make yourself at home.
- It's good you're here.

411
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
How did you find her?

412
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,560
- Hélène?
- Yes.

413
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,280
- Fine. Why?
- I thought she looked poorly.

414
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,800
You think
the whole world looks poorly.

415
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,320
In any case,
we never agree on anything.

416
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,440
You're always so anxious,
you don't enjoy the good times.

417
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
This is a good time?

418
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,680
Our sister is ill,
one of us have to make a sacrifice.

419
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,800
My head hurts!

420
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,680
Shit, look!
And you say we're lucky!

421
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,160
It isn't about luck.
You park illegally, you get fined.

422
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,480
- What was that?
- Nothing. Get in.

423
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,320
You park illegally, you get fined!

424
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,760
You feel guilty about your sister

425
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,160
because she's always been ill,
and you're healthy.

426
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,880
Guilty.

427
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,720
Yes, that's right. Guilty.

428
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,760
Guilt.

429
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,960
As for my brother, I feel no guilt.

430
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,600
With him, it's more like jealousy.

431
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
Jealousy, yes.

432
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,040
You feel guilty

433
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,560
about your sister
and jealous of your brother.

434
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,040
- Now you'll say, "And love?"
- I'm saying nothing.

435
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,840
But there is love
and affection, for sure.

436
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,840
For my sister,
even for my brother.

437
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,240
The thing is,
I don't know if he loves me.

438
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,800
What do you mean?

439
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,080
It's like he looks down on me.

440
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,440
He's always thought I was crap.

441
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,840
Then again,
I've done nothing amazing.

442
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,480
I've written 2 stories for free mags
and a novel no one wants.

443
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,560
That's why
if I could donate my kidney,

444
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,600
if I'm chosen,

445
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll feel I've achieved something,

446
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,360
served a purpose,
and he'll look at me differently.

447
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,880
- He'll look at you differently.
- Yes.

448
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,920
Is that important?

449
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,560
You're weird.

450
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,480
You know what?
We'll stop here for today.

451
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,320
- The session isn't over.
- Well, I'm done.

452
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,640
Stay if you like,
but I'm out of here.

453
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,040
See you next week.
Goodbye, Doctor.

454
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,600
I feel so much better.

455
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,760
Your blood tests show

456
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,600
you're both compatible.

457
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,600
Great!

458
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,280
But before I explain
what's going to happen now,

459
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,120
I'd like to congratulate you

460
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,840
for your gesture
and your physical courage.

461
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,720
- "Physical courage"?
- You need it.

462
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,200
It's an operation after all.

463
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,120
But you'll be saving someone's life.

464
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,280
Thank you.

465
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,320
It's an operation.

466
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,280
As you're both volunteering,

467
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,360
you're doubling
your sister's chances.

468
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,360
But as we will not remove a kidney
of a person in poor health,

469
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,040
you'll have a battery of tests
and we'll pick whoever

470
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,080
is in the best condition.

471
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,240
- He is.
- No. You are.

472
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,480
That's a lie. He is.
He's strong.

473
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,000
What kind of tests
are we talking about?

474
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,040
The heart,

475
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,080
the kidneys, the lungs...

476
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,520
Basically, we'll check everything.

477
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,680
Then the person who is chosen,

478
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,960
if one of you is chosen,

479
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,320
will go before a committee
which will agree or not

480
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,160
to the operation.
- Alright.

481
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,480
It's a formality
to protect the donor.

482
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,200
- OK.
- The living donor.

483
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,000
If we die,
our family can't sue the doctor?

484
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,440
- No.
- Alright.

485
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,160
But let's avoid hypotheses which...

486
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,160
Always the worst.

487
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,920
You've got a one-track mind:
the worst, the worst!

488
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,880
Yes, hello?

489
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,880
Really?

490
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,360
How did that happen?

491
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,240
I was sure it'd be fine.

492
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,960
I can't talk now.
I have patients.

493
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,680
No. I'll call you...

494
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,840
I'll call you after.

495
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,240
Call the insurance company,
the agency,

496
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,160
and turn the water off.

497
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,680
Sorry,
my wife panics over nothing.

498
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,080
I hear you!

499
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,600
Right. Let's get back
to our discussion.

500
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,720
- What's that?
- Homeopathic pills.

501
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,720
The first thing we'll check
is your lungs.

502
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,800
Hello, I'm here for a lung x-ray.

503
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,880
Your health card, please.

504
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,000
- Mr Perez.
- Yvan Perez.

505
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,920
Here. Perfect.

506
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Take a seat, please.

507
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,280
Come here and place
your chest against the plate.

508
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,120
Put the chain in your mouth.

509
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,480
Press up against the machine.

510
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,240
An arm on each side.
We'll tell you to expand your lungs.

511
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,240
Expand your lungs.
Hold your breath.

512
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,440
You may breathe.

513
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,640
You may breathe, sir. Sir?

514
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,160
Let go of the handles.

515
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,480
Get dressed, please.

516
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,480
You can get dressed.
It's over.

517
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,560
It's bad, isn't it?

518
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,240
- Do you smoke?
- Not at all. Why?

519
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,120
How's my x-ray?

520
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,920
Jérôme!
Could you come here?

521
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,880
I'm a goner, aren't I?

522
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,400
No need to be a smoker
to have a lung condition.

523
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Please, sir.
It isn't that bad yet.

524
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,480
- But it soon will be!
- Calm down, sir.

525
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,560
I am calm.

526
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,200
Tell me what's going on.

527
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,360
- Well, this area here...
- Yes.

528
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,400
We don't understand.

529
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
- We can't read it.
- What now?

530
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
We'll do another.

531
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,640
- Excellent! Your lungs are perfect.
- Thank you.

532
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,520
You had me scared.

533
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,640
I can feel my heart!

534
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
I have an appointment.

535
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,720
- Put that out, please.
- Sorry.

536
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,640
- May I?
- Go ahead.

537
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,080
- Your appointment?
- For a lung x-ray.

538
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,080
Your health card.

539
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,480
I wasn't told I'd need it.

540
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,640
- Your name?
- Perez, Max. Perez with a Z.

541
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,600
- OK. Can you wait?
- Of course.

542
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,680
"This Eastern splendour
Would appeal

543
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,760
"With its tranquillous native tongue.

544
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,960
"There, all is order and loveliness,

545
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,280
"Luxury, calm and voluptuousness."

546
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,000
Benaroche.

547
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,760
Knock before entering
and give me your note.

548
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,760
Don't do my head in.
Pretend I'm not here.

549
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,400
- I'll call you back.
- Your mobile!

550
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,440
I've put in on silent.
Continue your thing.

551
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
If you'd been on time, Benaroche,

552
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,520
you'd have heard my thing
is Baudelaire.

553
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,360
- Charles Baudelaire.
- Yes. Baudelaire.

554
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,960
I sent it to ten publishers,

555
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,720
and so far
four have turned me down.

556
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,120
For the others, I've no illusions.

557
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,640
But it's OK, I'm not demoralized.

558
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,720
I enjoy writing.
When I'm sick of it, I'll stop.

559
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,800
Seeing anyone?

560
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,080
Don't you start too!

561
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,880
Don't you think it's time
you led a more stable life?

562
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,840
I don't feel ready for that.

563
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,560
When you are, it might be too late.

564
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,560
You sound like Mum.

565
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,360
- Introduce me to your girlfriends.
- Like you need me!

566
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,600
And you?

567
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,000
I feel ready,
but men don't seem to.

568
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,280
How's...
What was his name?

569
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,880
The big funny guy with a beard.
Thierry.

570
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,640
- Why aren't you with him?
- That was 5 years ago.

571
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,360
He's fine.
He got married and had a kid.

572
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,080
And since then?

573
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,440
- Do you want coffee?
- What time is it?

574
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,720
11. No. I'll have a beer.

575
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,280
- We're pretty lucky this year.
- No troublemakers.

576
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,560
That's rare.

577
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,040
You're lucky.
I've got a really tough one.

578
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,240
Verging on aggressive.

579
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,640
- I don't know how to handle him.
- Who is he?

580
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,520
- Benaroche.
- He's a special case.

581
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,080
He was well behaved.

582
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,880
His mum got sick.
He's really disturbed by it.

583
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,080
- For sure.
- What's wrong with her?

584
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,000
A kidney disease, I think.

585
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,360
If he makes trouble,
you have to report him.

586
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,360
Yes...

587
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,080
- See you.
- OK.

588
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,680
Philippe! You're home.

589
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,600
I wasn't expecting you.

590
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,640
How are you?

591
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,080
Thanks.

592
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,640
- So what's new in your life?
- Oh... And you?

593
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,240
- Still a writer?
- Yeah. Trying to be.

594
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,040
- How was Burma?
- Bolivia? Great!

595
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Yes, Bolivia.

596
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,120
I meant to come home sooner.
You know how it is.

597
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,120
Jesus, you'll have to find a crib.

598
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,880
- No?
- Yes.

599
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,520
- Seriously?
- Sure.

600
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,160
But, Philippe,
this is a really bad time.

601
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,520
I don't have a plan B.

602
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,360
I don't give a toss, Max.

603
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,600
We had a deal.
I come home and get my flat back.

604
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,960
You haven't given me any warning!

605
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,080
There's loads of room.

606
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,880
We won't get in each other's way.

607
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,200
Yeah, yeah.

608
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,520
There's loads of room,
but I don't want to.

609
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,480
Philippe, you've changed.
You're acting like a bailiff!

610
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,080
Give me time to sort myself out.
2 or 3 weeks.

611
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,360
You've had a month.
That's enough.

612
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,120
48 hours, come on.

613
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,920
No.

614
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,160
- Why are you doing here?
- Surprise! Is the box room free?

615
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,400
Good evening!

616
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,080
You're here
and I'm alone in my huge flat.

617
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,160
It's silly.

618
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,520
That smells good.
What's for supper?

619
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,800
For next week,
think about donating organs.

620
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,960
- What organ, sir?
- Your willy.

621
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,120
Stop that.

622
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,200
Who would agree
to donate their kidney, for example?

623
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,840
It depends which.

624
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,080
Who wouldn't?

625
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Right.

626
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,880
Those who didn't answer
must be undecided.

627
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,600
Benaroche, may I have a word?

628
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,760
I heard about your family problems.

629
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,360
My sister is sick,

630
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,040
and I might be giving her my kidney.

631
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,040
- Want to talk about it?
- No.

632
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,040
- Why?
- It's boring!

633
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,080
If you change your mind, I'm here.

634
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,560
- Is this room 20?
- Yes.

635
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,040
- Thanks.
- Ah no, there's a queue.

636
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,240
- Obviously!
- I didn't see. No need to get mad!

637
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
Ah, you're here!

638
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,920
We're together.

639
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,640
Have you been here long?

640
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,560
- About an hour.
- An hour?

641
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,120
They're taking the piss.
I've got stuff to do.

642
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,680
"Stuff"? What stuff?

643
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,120
Nothing, but it's really slow.
They can't do this.

644
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,040
They ask us to be on time.

645
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
We're together.

646
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,960
I'll go there.

647
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,640
- You're jumping the queue!
- I'm just leaning.

648
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,760
The problem, with my brother,
is I represent

649
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,240
everything he hates.

650
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,680
- What does he hate?
- My lifestyle,

651
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,120
my job, my need to be useful,

652
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
the desire to have a family.

653
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,760
He can't attack that,
so he attacks other things.

654
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,840
Such as?

655
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,960
My fear, my anxiety, my worries.

656
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,400
Once

657
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,360
I told him I was seeing a shrink.

658
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,520
He made fun of me.
He'd never go see a shrink.

659
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,240
- How do you know?
- It's obvious you don't know him.

660
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,920
But if I end up on
the operating table, well...

661
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,120
he won't see me in the same way.

662
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,920
He won't be able to say
what he usually does.

663
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,280
"Feeble", "hypochondriac",
"scared of everything"...

664
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,960
He'll have to respect me then.

665
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,240
You're agreeing to the operation
so he respects you?

666
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,560
That's rubbish.

667
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,800
Actually, I don't know.

668
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,720
Why not? Of course.

669
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,520
Yes, it's true.

670
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,000
- Professor.
- Do we have an appointment?

671
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,960
No. But I needed
to ask you something.

672
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,200
- I'm in a hurry.
- It'll only take 30 seconds.

673
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,440
But don't mention it to my family.
You can tell your wife.

674
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,200
Yes. Go ahead.

675
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,280
Would it be possible,
for the results of the tests...

676
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,520
I'm just asking.

677
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,400
Couldn't we maybe, for instance,

678
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,840
disqualify my brother?

679
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,400
- Disqualify him?
- Kick him out of the competition?

680
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,800
We say I'm in better health,
which is true,

681
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,120
and say he has
a minor heart condition.

682
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,640
When he stresses,
his heart beats fast.

683
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,400
Tell him he has tachycardia,

684
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,280
and that's why you've selected me.

685
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,520
You want to fix the results?

686
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,440
Fix them, no.
Enhance them.

687
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,360
Mr Perez, in my profession,
there's a code of ethics.

688
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,640
It's a kind of professional honesty
which forbids such things.

689
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,880
In 35 years,
I've never heard anything like it.

690
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,680
I'm not asking you
to do anything serious.

691
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,800
You won't get sent to prison.

692
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,880
I know who you are.

693
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,400
I'm asking you.
Just say yes or no.

694
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,520
The answer is no.

695
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,560
- Think about it.
- I said no.

696
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,880
- Think some more.
- I've thought enough.

697
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,520
I never spoke to you.
This conversation never happened.

698
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,240
I'd rather forget it too.

699
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,400
I didn't ask you to favour me.

700
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,800
- Done this before?
- No.

701
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,400
Put this on and remove your chain.

702
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,720
- It's a lucky charm.
- Put it on later.

703
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,880
I can't take it off.
It's a lucky charm

704
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,720
and I'm having a scan.

705
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,360
You can't have a scan
with a thing round your neck.

706
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,120
Your chain.

707
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,000
I'll give it back.

708
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,600
Expand your lungs
and hold your breath.

709
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,720
That's it. Great. Don't move.

710
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,320
OK, you can breathe.

711
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,840
OK, darling? I forgot my keys.

712
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,120
You had a call.

713
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,840
- Who was it?
- The professor.

714
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,040
The professor?

715
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,440
What did he want?

716
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,400
He wouldn't say.
You're to call him tomorrow.

717
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,840
- It must be bad news.
- Why?

718
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,440
The scan must have been terrible.
He wanted to discuss it.

719
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,040
- You always think the worst.
- I always think the...

720
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,280
- Where's the number?
- On your desk.

721
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,600
Shit!

722
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,040
- Yes.
- Hi, Max. You OK?

723
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,120
Did Professor Legendre
try to reach you?

724
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,000
No. Why?

725
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,280
He did me.
There's no reason

726
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,880
for him to call me.
- And?

727
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,840
- Well, I'm worried.
- That's par for the course,

728
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,000
isn't it?

729
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,320
Is that all? I'm busy.
See you, bye.

730
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,720
I don't like this.

731
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,880
Calm down.
He sounded very relaxed.

732
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,160
Precisely!

733
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,560
Doctors are always relaxed
when they announce a disaster.

734
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,280
I'm making dinner.
Are you hungry?

735
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,120
"Hungry"?

736
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,000
How could I be hungry?

737
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
No, no appointment.
But he called me

738
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,280
at home. It's urgent.

739
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,560
I can fit you in next week.

740
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,120
You can't be serious!

741
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,480
"Next week"?
He called me.

742
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,840
- Really?
- Yes!

743
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,320
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

744
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,000
Mr Perez, good to see you!
Come with me.

745
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:39,960
Thank you.

746
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,160
Cécile, this won't take long.

747
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,040
Have a seat.

748
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,880
I called you yesterday.
It's a delicate matter,

749
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,840
serious even.

750
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,040
- Go on, just tell me.
- I'm bound

751
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,760
by my oath,
but sometimes one has

752
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,280
to bend the rules.
- But this is about me.

753
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,720
It isn't about you.
You're OK.

754
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,720
- Really?
- Yes.

755
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,120
I met David Benaroche.
He's one of your students?

756
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,440
Yes, of course. Why?

757
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,720
His mum is in my department,
and he heard you were going

758
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,880
to donate an organ.

759
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,200
He is very affected
by his mum's illness

760
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,920
and wants to give her a kidney.

761
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,560
I told him he was too young,

762
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,160
and you know what he said?
- No.

763
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,120
That he would go
to one of these countries where...

764
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,320
"Where" what?

765
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,440
Where with a bit of cash,
you can have an op.

766
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,880
You can have an op,
and even buy an organ

767
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,280
in conditions you can imagine.

768
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,280
Unbelievable!

769
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,160
Yes. Right, well...

770
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,440
He said the money
wouldn't be a problem.

771
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,720
Yes. His family is wealthy.

772
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,200
- Actually, no.
- I don't understand.

773
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,560
He's going to do something stupid,
you know, like rob a bank.

774
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,560
He's 17.

775
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,880
So I'm very worried
and I thought that...

776
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,840
maybe you could talk to him.
He really admires you.

777
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,320
- Admires me?
- Yes.

778
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,280
He isn't exactly demonstrative,
but he thinks you're very brave.

779
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,280
He wants to do like you.

780
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,280
He wants to be like you.

781
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,640
OK. That's fine.

782
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,440
That too.

783
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,080
Everything's perfect.

784
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,360
Absolutely perfect.
You just have superficial keratitis.

785
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,080
- What's that?
- An inflammation of the cornea.

786
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,440
Right! When I was small,
I was made to wear contacts

787
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,920
and I had a reaction.

788
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,640
I had big red eyes like a rabbit!
It was awful.

789
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,280
Wear glasses.

790
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,000
- No.
- Why?

791
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,000
They wouldn't suit me.
It would ruin my charm.

792
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,360
- Don't you think?
- If you say so.

793
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,560
I'm a thinker.
Glasses should be part of the look!

794
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,560
I'm a novelist.

795
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,040
Novelist, songwriter,
playwright and...

796
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,000
OK.

797
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,000
That's it. This is for you.
And we're done.

798
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,000
- Is that it?
- Yes, that's it.

799
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,440
Already?

800
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,880
- Have you seen my brother?
- Yes. He's fine too.

801
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,760
That's kind of surprising.
Right, well, thanks.

802
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,760
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

803
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,080
It's fabulous what you're doing.

804
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,240
- Stop! Don't be stupid!
- What are you doing, Mr Perez?

805
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,880
I'm taking money out.

806
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,320
- Really?
- Um, yeah.

807
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,240
- Ah! OK?
- Er, yeah.

808
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,720
- Come chat.
- No.

809
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,000
Just two minutes. Come on.

810
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,080
OK?

811
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,160
I spoke about your mum
to Prof. Legendre.

812
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,600
Listen to me. He never said no
about a transplant.

813
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,440
But you have to be fully grown.
You're only 17.

814
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,320
- How long will it take?
- A few years.

815
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,760
In the meantime,
your mum can continue the dialysis.

816
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,920
My sister had it for 12 years.

817
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,960
And your mum's renal insufficiency
is much less serious.

818
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,480
Forget the idea of going abroad.

819
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,520
Your mum will get
the best treatment here.

820
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,800
- Want her to risk her life?
- No.

821
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,960
Well, that's it then.

822
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,960
I know you and I
don't get on very well in class,

823
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,040
but we can talk outside.

824
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,880
When's your operation?

825
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,320
At the end of the year.
There's me and my brother.

826
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,960
I don't know who'll be chosen.

827
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,360
- Do you have siblings?
- A little brother who's 11.

828
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,480
- You're lucky.
- Yes.

829
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,480
Go on, more, more, more...

830
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,440
- How do you feel?
- Great!

831
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,600
Good.

832
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,720
You'd have made an excellent runner.

833
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,320
Of course!

834
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,960
Go easy though. Easy now.

835
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,960
Right, I think that'll do.

836
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,040
Yes! Absolutely.

837
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,640
Maybe I have heart trouble.

838
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,680
It isn't always obvious.

839
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,680
I'm a doctor.
I'm here. Carry on.

840
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,400
When Goscinny died,

841
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,520
his doctor was there too.

842
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,600
- Whose doctor?
- Goscinny's!

843
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,120
Asterix!

844
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,800
Look, I saw your brother.
He did very well.

845
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,840
Come on, pedal, pedal.

846
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,440
Me and my brother are different.

847
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,520
The machine
doesn't agree with you at all.

848
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,240
Like your brother,
you have a young man's heart.

849
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:20,920
Thanks.

850
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,800
Thank you, Doctor.

851
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,640
- Alright?
- Tired.

852
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,480
I feel like a lab rat.

853
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,200
Another day wasted with their crap!

854
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,520
You have important stuff to do?

855
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,040
What's with the dumb remarks?

856
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,200
I work too, you know!

857
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,200
It interests me to know how I am.

858
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,240
My body, my organs...

859
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,400
What else do you have to do?

860
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,680
What else to do I have do?
Write!

861
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,520
It's my job. I write.

862
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,400
- Ah yes, you write. I'd forgotten.
- Yeah!

863
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,120
You should quit.

864
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,040
Sorry?

865
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,320
You've been trying for 15 years.

866
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,600
You're nowhere.

867
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,120
It isn't your thing.
Don't be ashamed.

868
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,040
Talent isn't something you decide.

869
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,320
Who are you to judge anyway?

870
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,000
I go by results,
and you're not making a living.

871
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,360
Not yet.

872
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,240
- Forget it.
- Change your tone!

873
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,040
I'm just being straight with you.

874
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,760
- May I be straight with you?
- Yes.

875
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,480
Want to know
why I chose to write?

876
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,920
To not be like you.
When I see you

877
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,760
with your briefcase,

878
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,320
I'm happy I chose another life.

879
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,280
- There!
- What life, Max?

880
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,280
You live off other people.

881
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,040
You ask Mum and Dad
to pay your bills.

882
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,880
Keep your money.
This is on me.

883
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,960
- Got anything smaller?
- He does. But I'm paying.

884
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,560
For the next tests,
we won't go the same day.

885
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,480
I don't want to see your face.

886
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,920
That's for you.

887
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,560
I told him everything
I've held back for years.

888
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,840
Actually...

889
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,080
I regret it.

890
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,800
You regret it?

891
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,760
You don't have to tell the truth
all of the time.

892
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,120
It had no effect on him whatsoever.

893
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,240
He doesn't give a damn.

894
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,800
He just hates me a bit more...

895
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,600
He isn't going to change.

896
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,880
"He isn't going to change."

897
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,440
No. I was wrong.

898
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,520
I was wrong.

899
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,760
He's right.

900
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,440
Of course he's right.

901
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,440
What he said is true,
but I refuse to accept it.

902
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,520
I know I'm lazy,
a parasite, a good-for-nothing.

903
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,800
- I know that.
- Yes?

904
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,720
- Please switch it off.
- Shush.

905
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,920
Hello?

906
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,440
Yes, it's me.

907
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,280
When do you want to see me?

908
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,000
Right away?
Yes. I'm not doing anything.

909
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,160
Nothing important.

910
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,920
Yes, I have your address.
See you soon.

911
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,480
- Bad news?
- I have to go.

912
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,080
Goodbye, Doctor.

913
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,360
It was great.

914
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,640
Great!

915
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,560
I've read your manuscript,
The Peppercorn.

916
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,720
It's original, but way out there.

917
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,080
It lacks dramatic effect,

918
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,560
there 40 incomprehensible pages,
it's full of spelling mistakes.

919
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,880
How many publishers
have you sent it to?

920
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,640
- About twenty.
- Had any replies?

921
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,960
Yes. 5 or 6 are quite interested.

922
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:07,680
But you know what it's like,
we then have to agree.

923
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,840
- Who?
- I don't recall all the names.

924
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,320
Who was there?

925
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,240
There was... Le Peuplier Editions.

926
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,640
They were quite interested.

927
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,480
Cerisier literary review.

928
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,960
Well, it's...

929
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,560
- Why are you asking?
- Because I want to publish you.

930
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,400
- I'm hardly surprised.
- I said,

931
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,760
I want to publish you.

932
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,760
- What do you mean?
- We're publishing your book.

933
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,000
- Is this a joke?
- I have no sense of humour.

934
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,760
Alright. After what you told me,
I don't really understand.

935
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,240
We get rid of the 40 pointless pages,

936
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,280
correct your spelling
and bring out the book.

937
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,320
You have that little something
I'm looking for.

938
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,120
Um, thank you.

939
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,600
Thanks. It's...

940
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,160
I've never been published.

941
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,640
You have to start somewhere.

942
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,240
I didn't understand!

943
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,200
Great. Awesome.

944
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,320
Honey?

945
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,400
You're filming me?
You're late.

946
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,720
Anything serious?

947
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,480
- No, but I'm late.
- 55 minutes.

948
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,800
More. Much more. 20 days.

949
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,640
I'm 55 minutes late
because I'm 20 days late.

950
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,480
Hang on!

951
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,920
The doctor says we did a good job.

952
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,400
- Oh shit!
- Nice!

953
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,200
Is that all you can say? "Shit"?

954
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,760
But it's...

955
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,600
- You're pregnant?
- Yes.

956
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,960
For sure?

957
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,040
Sure, sure, sure!

958
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,000
- Isn't it great?
- It's awesome!

959
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,880
- We wanted a kid, huh?
- We'd stopped talking about it.

960
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,680
Only because of your sister,

961
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,320
but we never said
we'd forget about it.

962
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,240
Or have you changed your mind?

963
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,560
- When's it due?
- January, February.

964
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,200
Do you realize if things go wrong,

965
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,000
it'll be a little orphan?

966
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,640
The birth?

967
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,360
- Not the birth, the transplant.
- Don't talk nonsense.

968
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,760
I don't want to die
without seeing my son.

969
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,720
You're not going to die
and no one said it's a boy.

970
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,280
The sex is the 4th month.

971
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,120
- Who have you told?
- No one.

972
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,520
- I will on Sunday.
- Why "Sunday"?

973
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,040
It's your parents'
wedding anniversary.

974
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,320
Had you forgotten?

975
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,840
Oh no.

976
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,520
I got scarf for Mum
and a cap for Dad.

977
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,520
I'm giving them a home cinema.

978
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,160
- You're not?
- I am.

979
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,840
They're ruining their eyes
with that old telly.

980
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,880
It'll be delivered this week.
Plasma, full HD, 138 cm,

981
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,680
200 MHz, DVD player, Blu-ray,

982
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,360
Dolby 7.1, great sound, the works!

983
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,760
- They cost a bomb!
- Sure do.

984
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,200
- But I've made some money.
- What?

985
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,040
Surprise.

986
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,120
I just spoke to Yvan.
He didn't sound keen about coming.

987
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,320
Why's that?

988
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,080
- Max.
- What?

989
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,680
- Are you getting on?
- Yeah. Why?

990
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,160
- He asked if you were here.
- Jerk!

991
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,000
Where else would I be
on your wedding anniversary?

992
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,000
In church?

993
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,280
René, are they coming or not?

994
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,560
- They're coming, Sonia.
- The food's burning!

995
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,920
- So everything's fine.
- Yes, it is!

996
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,440
- There's a napkin missing.
- In the sideboard drawer.

997
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,320
- Which?
- What do you think?

998
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,280
- Are you parking like that?
- Yes.

999
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,240
You'll be able to make up.

1000
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,520
Let me handle it.

1001
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,000
- Don't argue at lunch.
- My brother is my business.

1002
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,360
- You're so complicated!
- Stop defending him.

1003
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,520
I'm not. But you're going
to spoil the atmosphere.

1004
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,680
Wait for me!

1005
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,880
Yvan, could you pass the sauce?

1006
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,280
Thanks.

1007
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,840
- Alice, bread?
- Thanks.

1008
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,520
Me and Yvan have some good news.

1009
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,360
- You're divorcing?
- I'm serious.

1010
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,000
- You're pregnant.
- Yes!

1011
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,880
- Who by?
- Very funny.

1012
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,480
- That's fab!
- An Aquarius.

1013
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,520
- Like me!
- I hope not.

1014
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,920
- I've been waiting so long.
- I'll be an auntie!

1015
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,800
It's the best gift
you could have given us.

1016
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,240
We were despairing.
It's great. Well done!

1017
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,200
Gramps and Nan!

1018
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,040
- I've got some good news too.
- You're having a kid?

1019
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,600
You're not far off, but no.

1020
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,680
My novel is being published.

1021
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,920
I've signed a contract.

1022
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,760
- I got an advance. Look!
- I am.

1023
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,720
To anyone who thinks
there's a jerk in the family

1024
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,480
who writes crap,
well, this crap is being published

1025
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,000
and is bringing in money.
So there!

1026
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,960
- I'm so proud!
- Don't I get a kiss?

1027
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,880
Right, I'll raise my glass.

1028
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,200
- My glass, Dad.
- Mine is empty.

1029
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,600
- Careful.
- Thanks.

1030
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,280
Watch out. Here.

1031
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,480
Right...

1032
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,960
Two pieces of good news
in one day, we're spoiled.

1033
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,160
- Thanks, kids!
- Happy anniversary.

1034
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,760
That's right, it's our anniversary!

1035
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,360
What a joke!

1036
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,040
He thinks he's a writer now!

1037
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,120
If he knew how many books
sink without a trace!

1038
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,440
It's mad.
He thinks he's Flaubert!

1039
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,360
- Money, success!
- It's still good news.

1040
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,400
It will be
when he's sold 10,000 copies.

1041
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,080
Not everyone can do that.

1042
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,160
If it's being published, it's good.

1043
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,160
"If it's being published, it's good"?
You can be so naive!

1044
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,040
You haven't read it!

1045
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,560
I've read everything.

1046
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,880
I told him I found it
trivial and immature, like him.

1047
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,560
Hello?

1048
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,160
Yes. It's me.

1049
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,600
- OK?
- Yes.

1050
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,360
- You left in a hurry.
- I had homework to correct.

1051
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,040
I just wanted to say
I'm really happy for you.

1052
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,680
- For us?
- About the baby.

1053
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,400
That's kind.

1054
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,160
- Are you happy about my book?
- Which book? Yes. Sure.

1055
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,440
Very happy.

1056
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,200
I'll sign a copy

1057
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,000
for you.
- There's no need. If you like.

1058
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,640
I'll be the baby's godfather.

1059
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,040
You're its uncle.
It isn't bad already.

1060
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,080
Yeah. It isn't bad already.

1061
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,360
Did you call just for that?

1062
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,120
- Are you mad?
- On the contrary.

1063
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,680
- I'm really pleased.
- Me too,

1064
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,960
I'm really pleased.

1065
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,040
Love you.

1066
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,040
Ciao.

1067
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,200
There!

1068
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,240
Happy now?

1069
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,160
Right.

1070
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,480
Hello, Doctor!

1071
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:56,200
Sorry to have rushed off,
but it was really important.

1072
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,760
My book is being published.
A publisher loved it. I'm thrilled!

1073
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
- Lie down.
- I haven't come to lie down.

1074
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,640
The couch is over.
I feel good.

1075
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,640
I've made up with my brother.
All's well. I'm cured.

1076
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,240
- You weren't sick.
- Don't mince words.

1077
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,560
I consulted you
because I wasn't well.

1078
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,640
By the way, this is for you.

1079
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,320
- How many sessions is it for?
- It's your special bonus.

1080
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,560
When I'm happy, I show it.

1081
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,000
- You did a good job.
- No, Mr Perez.

1082
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,840
I have a code of ethics.

1083
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,880
You don't want my 500 euros?
You shrinks have a real problem!

1084
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,360
- 50 for today's session.
- If you like.

1085
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,000
May I hug you?
When I'm happy, I show it.

1086
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,760
I'm going to praise you.
People will be queuing up!

1087
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,480
In a year, you'll have a Rolls.
With a chauffeur!

1088
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,440
Next!

1089
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,160
All the tests are done.

1090
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,600
You're both in perfect health.

1091
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,960
Glad to hear it!
I was sick of your tests.

1092
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,880
- I found them instructive.
- Obviously!

1093
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,280
The scan shows
excellent renal function

1094
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,000
and it's identical.

1095
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,720
- Amusing, huh?
- Very.

1096
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,480
Very, very funny! So?

1097
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,480
Which of us is...

1098
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,200
- That's just the problem.
- So there's a problem.

1099
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,160
No. Both of you are suitable
for this type of operation

1100
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,040
without it weakening you.
It's impossible

1101
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,200
to decide either way.

1102
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,520
That's why I thought the decision

1103
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,360
should be made by you.

1104
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,360
Meaning?

1105
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,560
You will designate the donor.

1106
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:42,960
Him or me?

1107
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,120
You're saying you want us
to decide together

1108
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,160
who is willing
to have the operation?

1109
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,880
From what I understand,
you're both willing.

1110
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,920
- Yes.
- But surely one of you

1111
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,000
is more willing than the other.

1112
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,080
Yes. Well, yes.

1113
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,840
- Yes.
- Of course. Yes.

1114
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,680
It's understandable though...

1115
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,920
you weren't ready for the question,

1116
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,080
but you have time
to think about it.

1117
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,800
Precisely.
When do you need an answer?

1118
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,400
There are two important steps.

1119
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,600
Let's say...

1120
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,560
tomorrow.
- Ah, right!

1121
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,080
- Or the day after.
- The day after tomorrow?

1122
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,040
The operation is in 3 weeks,
on June 21.

1123
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,440
June 21?

1124
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,160
World Music Day.

1125
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,960
- You can't smoke in hospital!
- We're outside.

1126
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,080
- There are sick people.
- There aren't any outside.

1127
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,320
- There are sick people everywhere.
- Where?

1128
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,560
Everywhere!

1129
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,200
Is that yours?

1130
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,600
Awesome, huh?

1131
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,560
Did you borrow it?

1132
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,120
Yeah, I borrowed it!
No, dummy. I bought it.

1133
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,560
Oh yeah, that's right!

1134
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,720
I had to borrow some dosh.

1135
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,680
Some dosh!
Can't you say money?

1136
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,720
Right.

1137
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,760
What about the transplant?

1138
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,320
- You or me?
- I don't know.

1139
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,400
We have to decide.

1140
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,520
- Got an idea?
- I have no idea.

1141
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,560
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

1142
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,400
- No idea. We wait.
- You know what?

1143
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,920
Let's toss a coin.

1144
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,680
- You're kidding?
- No.

1145
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:50,760
- Why not? Like that, we'll know.
- We'll know!

1146
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,360
- Seriously?
- Yes!

1147
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,880
The winner donates his kidney.
End of story!

1148
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,720
OK. Go on, then.

1149
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,320
Heads or tails?

1150
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,680
I have to choose?
Hails, then.

1151
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,520
Tails.

1152
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,640
Tails?

1153
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,600
- You're tails, I'm heads.
- Go on.

1154
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,840
Heads! I want heads.

1155
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,440
- Heads or tails?
- Heads, heads. Tails.

1156
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:18,360
Nothing!
I don't want anything.

1157
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,120
Nothing at all!
Heads or tails for a kidney.

1158
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,320
It was heads!

1159
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,560
It was me.

1160
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,680
- Where is she?
- In her room.

1161
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,800
Hélène,

1162
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,040
it'll get cold!

1163
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,320
What were you up to in there?

1164
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,720
Sorting things out. Writing.

1165
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,840
- Writing what?
- Well, I...

1166
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,760
I wrote a note
to my friends in Lille.

1167
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,680
I just upped and left,

1168
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,880
without saying goodbye
to loads of people I'm fond of.

1169
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:30,240
If ever anything...
Will you send it to them?

1170
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,240
It's clear. I wrote the addresses.

1171
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,920
It's very simple.
You just have to post it.

1172
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,000
- When?
- After the operation. In case I...

1173
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,480
- You're nuts.
- You must be mad!

1174
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,200
I'm not saying it'll happen.

1175
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,480
- It's just if ever...
- "If ever" what?

1176
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,720
Why are you angry?

1177
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,000
Want me to dance?

1178
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,040
- Can't we discuss it calmly?
- No! We can't.

1179
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,440
Sorry.

1180
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,920
I shouldn't have asked you.
I'll ask someone else.

1181
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,440
- Because you think...
- I'm just planning.

1182
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,240
Alright, then.

1183
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,800
We'll do it. OK.

1184
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,040
No problem!

1185
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,720
- René, you...
- Dad!

1186
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,480
There.

1187
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,320
That way, it's sorted.

1188
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,360
After the operation,

1189
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,480
you'll go back to Lille
and your friends.

1190
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,440
You won't say goodbye,
you'll say hello.

1191
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,040
You're already up?
It's 6:30.

1192
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,480
I haven't slept.

1193
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,600
Have you decided?

1194
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,720
I'm not strong enough.

1195
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,000
I'm not brave enough.

1196
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,560
I can't do it.

1197
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,320
Max doesn't care.
He isn't afraid.

1198
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,320
Why take the person who's scared
when the other isn't?

1199
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,400
I'm a coward.

1200
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,280
You married a coward.

1201
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,640
No. No, you're not a coward.

1202
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,320
So what am I?

1203
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,200
- Only fools are never afraid.
- Really?

1204
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,360
I must be very, very smart!

1205
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,800
- Have you told Max?
- Not yet.

1206
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,040
He'll thank me.

1207
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,760
He'll jump at the chance
to play the hero!

1208
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,640
I've worked hard.

1209
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,480
I've replaced the 40 pages

1210
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,000
you wanted to cut
with a short chapter.

1211
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,800
I'm not one to boast,

1212
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,440
but I think it's awesome.

1213
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,200
What's this chapter about?

1214
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,920
I'll read it to you.
Do you have 30 minutes?

1215
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,920
"If you assume

1216
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,640
"everything has a meaning,

1217
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,040
"the fact the human body
has two of every organ,

1218
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,200
"is no coincidence.

1219
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,120
"We have two eyes,
two upper and lower limbs.

1220
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,520
"This binomy is..."

1221
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,280
Binomy.
The word doesn't exist.

1222
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,920
Who cares!
I know it doesn't exist.

1223
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,440
I invented it so the reader
would understand me better.

1224
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,240
That's the reason.
Binomy is evocative.

1225
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,040
"This binomy is intriguing.

1226
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,040
"Two organs means
there's a spare for someone.

1227
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,240
"We can live with one lung,
one eye, one ear or one kidney."

1228
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,080
- What's the link the book?
- There isn't one.

1229
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,080
That's what's great about it.

1230
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,800
It's a shambles, a patchwork,

1231
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,200
full of digressions.
All great writers digress.

1232
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,640
Alright, but what's your point?

1233
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,920
That nature is perfect.
We have two of everything.

1234
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,320
- We don't.
- We do.

1235
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,320
- No.
- Yes!

1236
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,080
We have one heart,
one stomach, one liver.

1237
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,320
- You're wrong.
- Your theory,

1238
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,440
I'm sorry to say, is feeble.

1239
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,360
I believe in it.

1240
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,520
I can talk about if I like.
It's my bloody book!

1241
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,080
But I'm publishing it.

1242
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,920
Now if you would like
to explain this crazy idea...

1243
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:21,880
It isn't crazy!

1244
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,640
Being an organ donor is important!

1245
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,640
I'm leading the operating team.

1246
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:37,160
There are six of is.
We will start with Mr Perez.

1247
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,200
- With me?
- Obviously.

1248
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,280
First we must remove the organ.

1249
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,720
Yes. Of course.

1250
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,360
It will start at 8 am and last

1251
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,200
2 to 2 and a half hours.

1252
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,760
- In all?
- Just for you.

1253
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,440
We'll remove the kidney
and stitch you up.

1254
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,720
The professor must have said
the scar won't be visible.

1255
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,080
He didn't mention it.
How do you go about it?

1256
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,360
We perform a laparoscopy.

1257
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,240
We make a 5 to 7 cm-incision
to remove the organ.

1258
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,880
Then it's your sister's turn.

1259
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,240
Your operation will last 2 hours too.

1260
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,480
Alright.

1261
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:18,080
We'll know right away
if the transplant is a success.

1262
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,240
- The kidney should function.
- How will you know?

1263
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,080
To be crude, you'll start peeing.

1264
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,240
Urine may appear
before it's stitched up.

1265
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,760
Then you will all wake up,
and it'll be over.

1266
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,880
What if the transplant is no good,
and you realise right away?

1267
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,960
In such a case,

1268
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,360
do you put the kidney back?
You return it.

1269
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,520
That's never happened

1270
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,360
to me or any colleague
on this planet.

1271
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,080
When you operate on my sister,
as I'll be next to her...

1272
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,080
Seeing as I'll be right there!

1273
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,960
I understand your apprehension,
but it's never happened.

1274
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,040
Have there ever been cases
- I'm just asking -

1275
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,680
of donors not coping well?

1276
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,080
Of donors actually dying?

1277
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,080
You know, in surgery,
there's always a risk.

1278
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,960
How high is the risk?

1279
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,800
- 3 out of 1,000.
- 3 out of 1,000. That much?

1280
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,240
There are 3.
It's best not to be one of them!

1281
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,880
I have another question.

1282
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,600
When I wake up,
will I know if my brother's alright?

1283
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,160
He'll be awake, no?

1284
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,640
Indeed, when you wake up,
you'll be able to see

1285
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,240
how your brother is
as he'll be in the same room.

1286
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,400
That's all.

1287
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,360
Just one step left:
the living donor committee.

1288
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,400
It's crucial.

1289
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,080
- What's it like?
- It's an oral.

1290
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:50,680
It's a group of doctors
who assess your suitability

1291
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,400
and can cancel the operation.

1292
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,240
They can cancel it?

1293
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,920
Actually cancel it?

1294
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,480
Everything I've done,
they can just discard it?

1295
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,640
- Yes.
- How should I be?

1296
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,640
Natural and determined.

1297
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,240
Like a court jury.

1298
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,080
If they don't like me, I'm out!

1299
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,600
Natural and determined.

1300
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,800
Natural and...

1301
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,120
You OK?

1302
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,640
- Did you sleep there?
- No. I was waiting for you.

1303
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,680
- It's cold.
- Yes. Come on.

1304
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,280
Get up.

1305
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,040
You OK?

1306
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,480
I didn't sleep a wink either.

1307
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,200
- Here we are, Max.
- I'm scared.

1308
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,280
I'm not up to this, Yvan.
I can't do it.

1309
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,760
I'm not a hero.

1310
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,800
I'm a loser.
I'm scared stiff.

1311
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,200
No one can count on me.

1312
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,200
True or false?

1313
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,480
I'm not about to change now.

1314
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,840
I love life, you see?

1315
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,120
I feel great.
Things are starting to go well.

1316
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,480
I don't want to be butchered.

1317
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,240
I can't go! Not now.

1318
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,080
I'm just a big loser.

1319
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:44,840
No, Max.

1320
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,840
I don't know if you remember, but...

1321
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,680
Max.

1322
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,640
I must have been 10.

1323
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,800
Dad went to see Hélène in hospital.

1324
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,400
While they were gone,
you made a cake for Mum.

1325
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,400
They got home late.
You were asleep.

1326
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,240
I said I had made it.

1327
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,400
I remember, you bastard!

1328
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,520
Forgive me, Max.

1329
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,240
What are we going to do?

1330
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,000
- I'll do it.
- You?

1331
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Yes, me.

1332
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,720
Aren't you scared?

1333
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,200
Of course I'm scared
but not enough not to do it.

1334
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,440
We're going to save Linette.

1335
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,520
OK, Max?

1336
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:54,680
Thanks.

1337
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,720
We're going to do it.

1338
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,120
- Could you help me?
- Try me.

1339
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,560
Don't tell me it's what I wanted.

1340
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,240
It isn't what I wanted at all!

1341
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,880
I want to call it off.

1342
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,080
- You want to call it off?
- I'm having a baby!

1343
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,840
I'm absolutely convinced
I will never know him.

1344
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:40,640
When he's older, he'll be told,
"Your dad was a great guy.

1345
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,440
"He was perfect."

1346
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,120
Yeah, right! I'm a shit.

1347
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,560
Sit down.

1348
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,280
- Got any whisky?
- I don't serve alcohol.

1349
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,000
You're not in court.
Have a seat.

1350
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:05,520
Allow me to introduce Dr Lantier,
Dr Prévin, Dr Catala, Dr Bernard.

1351
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:06,680
I'm Dr Giraud.

1352
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:07,960
Yvan Perez.

1353
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,800
Don't be overawed.

1354
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,840
We're here to protect you.
You may speak freely.

1355
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,160
It isn't a test.

1356
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,600
We will guide you
and answer any questions

1357
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,400
you might have.

1358
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:24,280
Tell us about your family
and professional life.

1359
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,440
My name's Yvan Perez.

1360
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,240
I'm a French teacher,
married, with no children.

1361
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,000
Actually, yes!

1362
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,280
My wife is pregnant.

1363
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,160
- Congratulations. When's it due?
- February.

1364
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,960
- Boy or girl?
- We prefer surprises.

1365
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,800
How's your relationship
with your sister?

1366
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,720
Excellent.
We adore each other.

1367
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:51,320
She used to be my little sister
and she still is.

1368
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,040
- Did you take this decision alone?
- Yes.

1369
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:57,320
Well, I spoke to my wife, who agreed.

1370
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,520
And with my parents.

1371
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,120
They agreed too,

1372
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,400
which is normal because
they're my sister's parents.

1373
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,280
I wanted you to know
I see a psychotherapist.

1374
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,320
I discussed it with her.

1375
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,240
I wondered about it.

1376
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,400
Why do you see a psychotherapist?

1377
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,680
Do you have problems?

1378
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,320
No. I'm perfectly fine.
It's just that...

1379
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,120
I've been seeing her for years.
It balances me.

1380
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,440
Have you been told about the risks?

1381
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,840
Yes.

1382
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,440
Not during the operation,
but afterwards.

1383
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,840
Your life could be different.

1384
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,960
What do you mean?

1385
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,960
I see you drive a motorbike.

1386
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,680
No.

1387
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,880
It's a scooter. It's small.

1388
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,760
- A small scooter.
- You'll only have one kidney.

1389
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,280
Mister Perez, you don't have
to give us ready-made answers.

1390
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,840
There are no good or bad answers.
Just be sincere.

1391
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,320
You're expecting a child.

1392
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,280
Imagine he needs a kidney later,

1393
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,840
you won't be able
to give one to him.

1394
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,680
Yes, but my wife has two kidneys.

1395
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,880
She's in good health.

1396
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:12,840
I have your weight and height here.
Have you gained weight?

1397
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,160
Why?

1398
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,040
Your body mass index is fairly high.

1399
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,120
With one kidney,
you might have weight problems.

1400
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,880
I imagine you were told.

1401
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,280
Yes, I was.

1402
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,160
It isn't a problem.

1403
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,120
Do you have any questions?

1404
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,600
No.

1405
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,120
I don't have any questions.

1406
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,720
- He told you I'd agreed?
- Isn't it true?

1407
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,960
Of course it isn't.

1408
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,280
I'd turn the clock back if I could.

1409
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,280
- Go on. You still can.
- How's that?

1410
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,120
- He hasn't seen the judge.
- "Judge"?

1411
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,440
- At the High Court.
- When?

1412
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,600
- Right now.
- Thanks!

1413
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,560
LAW COURTS

1414
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,400
Mr Perez,
the judge will see you know.

1415
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,920
Please come with me.

1416
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,720
I would like you to sign
the organ removal form.

1417
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,320
- Yes, of course.
- I must ask you a question.

1418
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,280
Yes. Which question?

1419
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,640
Are you aware you are consenting
to the risk of death?

1420
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,640
Sorry? Could you repeat that?

1421
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,120
I must be sure
you are aware of the risk.

1422
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,480
It's a matter of informed consent.

1423
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,280
It's something I must ask.

1424
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,920
Alright.
Because actually Prof. Legendre...

1425
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,720
Are you well aware

1426
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,400
you are consenting
to the risk of dying?

1427
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,720
Sorry, Your Honour,
I have to visit the bathroom.

1428
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,120
I will ask you again.

1429
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:42,360
Are you aware you are consenting
to the risk of dying?

1430
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,440
- Actually, Prof. Legendre...
- I don't know him.

1431
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:00,000
If you would please sign here.

1432
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,000
Here.

1433
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,920
There. Where my finger is.

1434
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,000
It's here. Go settle in.

1435
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,440
Please go in.

1436
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:26,600
Thank you.

1437
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:37,560
Actually,
this is your brother's room.

1438
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,520
Yes.

1439
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,320
- Are you OK, honey?
- Yes.

1440
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,720
- Miss Perez?
- Yes.

1441
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,880
Come on, I'll show you your room.

1442
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,280
We'll come too.

1443
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,200
- Could you take my bag?
- Yes.

1444
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,360
Be right back.

1445
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:57,840
I'll go too.

1446
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,240
What's he up to?

1447
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,880
What are you doing?

1448
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,760
As you can see, I'm shaving.

1449
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,880
At 2 am?

1450
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,160
It'll be fine.

1451
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,080
Are you alright?
Any morning sickness?

1452
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,360
Alright, son?

1453
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,840
OPERATING ROOM

1454
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,640
Hello!

1455
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,040
I've got good news.

1456
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,600
It went well.
No complications.

1457
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:11,960
There.

1458
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,240
We were part of the statistics.

1459
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:19,000
In other words,
the 99.97 % success rate.

1460
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,760
My first memory
in the recovery room

1461
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,440
was Yvan giving me
a confident look.

1462
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,520
His eyes told me he was fine.

1463
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,360
And I thanked him with mine.

1464
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,800
Yvan couldn't believe he was alive!
We had loads of visitors.

1465
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,520
Yvan had to tell each of them,

1466
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:59,160
but he seemed happy to.

1467
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,000
Max is a real writer now.

1468
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,600
His book was published.

1469
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,440
It won't win the Goncourt,

1470
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,480
but he has the confidence
to write the next.

1471
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,600
And he has a fan.

1472
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,200
Glasses too.

1473
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,760
Alice gave birth to baby Basile.

1474
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,600
Yvan wasn't anxious at the birth.

1475
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,800
He was serene.

1476
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,160
He's like a new person.

1477
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:51,840
There...

1478
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,720
I guess that's a sense of family.

1479
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,040
As for me,

1480
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,760
my life isn't dictated
by dialysis now.

1481
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:19,800
Despite the anti-rejection drugs
I take every day,

1482
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,480
I don't feel there's
a foreign body in me.

1483
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,720
My brother gave me
what was missing from my life.

1484
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,880
I can think long term now.

1485
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,120
Like a writer with a block,

1486
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,320
I  have a fear of blank pages.

1487
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,000
I don't know where to begin.

1488
