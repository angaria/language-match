2
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,773
- Good morning!
- Fuck.

3
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,442
Morning.

4
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,570
Just, uh, getting back from the gym here.
It's an early workout.

5
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,781
Right. 'Cause that's a workout bustier.

6
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,116
It's a new costume element I'm working on.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,912
Sometimes you need to break 'em in.
'Cause they're very, very... they're tight.

8
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,208
Rosen, that white girl bullshit might work
on teachers and cops,

9
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,125
but not me.

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,503
- Rosen?
- This is your last warning.

11
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,546
You break curfew again, you're fired.

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,884
Look, are we still doing this whole
Louis Gossett Jr., Richard Gere thing?

13
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:51,802
Come on.

14
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,471
'Cause I really don't see you up
anybody else's asshole.

15
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,891
Other people don't piss me off as much.
And Sam put me in charge.

16
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,270
I'm official now. So, deal with it, Rosen.

17
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,111
Fuckin' anti-Semite.

18
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,666
Yeah.

19
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,182
When did we learn that move?

20
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,309
We didn't.

21
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,394
I think, just, nerds try harder.

22
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,399
All right.

23
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,947
- Sort of doing a werewolf thing over here.
- Yeah, I like it.

24
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,492
She's actually British,
which is impressive. These two.

25
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,120
And finally, our star.

26
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,040
Debbie,
I'd like you to meet Glen Klitnick,

27
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,043
our phenomenal executive at K-DTV,

28
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,296
aka, the man who's making all
of our dreams come true, huh?

29
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,091
Glen, I'd like you to meet
the beautiful Deborah Eagan.

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,345
You, of course,
know her best as Laura Morgan.

31
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,059
<i>- Paradise Cove.</i>
- Oh, uh... soap opera.

32
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,145
- Right? Yeah. I'm not a big soap guy.
- Oh.

33
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,149
My wife, Jodie,
she goes crazy for <i>All My Children.</i>

34
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,235
- You ever do anything there?
- They film in New York.

35
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,237
So, I've always been based in LA.

36
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,364
So, no.

37
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,075
Deb, why don't you show him
what you've been working on?

38
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,119
Okay. Uh, yeah.

39
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,288
So, I've just been practicing
some landings.

40
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,376
Um, so, if I did like a jump
off the ropes type thing,

41
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,129
I could sort of land
in like a somersault-y, um...

42
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,130
type thing.

43
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,799
I could just mark it for you.

44
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,096
And reset. Anyway. And then, um...

45
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,265
And then my, uh, character is...

46
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,767
is Liberty Belle.

47
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,644
She's the all-American hero.

48
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,398
Uh, she's kind of like the role model
for kids.

49
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,442
Um, so, I could then say something like...
Like...

50
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,778
"Be all that you can be."

51
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,948
Or like, "Say nope to dope."

52
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,199
That kind of thing.

53
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,828
I am a mom.

54
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,916
So, I know how important it is
to be patriotic.

55
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,169
Uh, but I'm still kind of working on it,
so...

56
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,924
Uh, well, I look forward to seeing it
when it's done.

57
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,469
- This way, Glen.
- Okay.

58
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,728
So, it's deeper than that, really.
Okay?

59
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,857
They're gonna be wrestling with their
own female stereotypes, metaphorically.

60
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,774
Do you understand?

61
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,236
I think that's something that'll
really resonate with female audiences.

62
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,572
And guys... Well, guys, let's be honest.

63
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,658
They're gonna watch
because girls wrestling is fucking hot.

64
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:06,121
Sure. Though Glen's
Saturday morning programming targets kids.

65
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,373
Hot and family friendly, Glen.

66
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,167
Porn you can watch with your kids.

67
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,668
Finally.

68
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,470
- Well, I have to say this is very strong.
- Glen.

69
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,014
Strong concept, strong timeslot.

70
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,892
I feel like we could be
making something special.

71
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,478
Providing we find the right sponsor.

72
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,022
- Sure.
- Wait, aren't you the sponsor?

73
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,107
Uh, Sam, I'm the producer. Heh.

74
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,609
Sponsor pays for airtime.

75
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,695
- How we doing with that, Glen?
- Well, we have a great lead.

76
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,197
Booming local business

77
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,574
looking to expand their profile
throughout the region.

78
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,285
Patio Town.

79
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,829
You mean, like, bird baths and shit?

80
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:51,792
Bird baths, furniture,
custom fire pits, you know.

81
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,335
They're the number-two purveyor

82
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,754
of indoor/outdoor lifestyle
in Southern California.

83
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,088
Wow.

84
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,381
What can we do, Glen?

85
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,467
They have a brand-new location
in Calabasas.

86
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,886
Grand opening this Friday,
the owner will be there.

87
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,805
We thought it might be
a wonderful opportunity

88
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,223
for a little meet and greet.

89
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,600
Bring a couple of the girls, you know.

90
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,144
That zippy Ruth girl.
Nail this puppy down.

91
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,397
We're gonna nail this puppy down so hard,
it'll think it's been crucified, huh?

92
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,194
I'm Liberty Belle, the American hero.

93
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,155
I'm a perfect ten, and you're a zero.

94
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,536
I'm American as apple pie,

95
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,413
and if you're not, I'll make you die.

96
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,044
So, what do you think?

97
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,632
- I never thought he was right for you.
- Oh, Mom.

98
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,967
Now is not the time.

99
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,679
Well, I just always thought
he was very controlling.

100
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,266
Please don't put me in the position
of having to defend the man I just left.

101
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,061
I'm not asking you to defend anybody.
I'm just worried about you.

102
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:57,274
You've always been so independent.
Now all of a sudden you're off in Pasadena

103
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,402
with a new belt for every outfit,
waiting for him to come home.

104
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,864
I made the choice to stop working.
I wanted to actually be there for my kid.

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,411
Well, it's nice you had the choice.

106
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,623
- Oh, Mom, I didn't mean...
- Honey, honey, honey.

107
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,667
I know.

108
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,295
Maybe you'll get back together.

109
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,131
Have another piece of bacon, Ron.

110
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,174
So, it's just gonna be for a few weeks.

111
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,677
Just in the daytimes during rehearsals.

112
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,096
Well, maybe some evenings here and there.
Um...

113
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,807
- Mark has him on weekends.
- Isn't that your friend Ruth?

114
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,854
Ruth?
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?

115
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,815
- Ruth and I are working together.
- My gosh, that's fabulous.

116
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,609
- Ron, isn't that fabulous?
- Very nice.

117
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,360
Come over here, honey, have a seat.

118
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,196
I would love to stay
and catch up with you,

119
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,490
but, you know, uh, actually, I...

120
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,160
came in to check the time,
and I gotta run to rehearsal.

121
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,370
It was so nice to see you, Lorene, really.

122
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,955
- Okay. Bye, hon.
- Bye, Ron.

123
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,917
- Debbie, isn't that nice that she's here?
- Yeah.

124
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,461
Really, after your father left,

125
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,006
if it wasn't for your Aunt Cathy,
I think I might have lost my mind.

126
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,591
Um, oh, I have to go.

127
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,885
So, extra clothes are in here,

128
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,138
extra bottles in the side pocket...

129
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,641
Yes, everything's under control.
Sweetie, go, go.

130
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,435
- All right. Okay, thank you.
- We're gonna have a good time.

131
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,938
- Aren't we? Yes, we are.
- Bye. Love you.

132
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,859
We're gonna have a good time,
aren't we?

133
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,321
Yeah, with Meemaw and Ron.

134
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,834
- Keith Bang.
<i>- Where's the beef?</i>

135
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,046
- Excuse me?
- <i>We've been wondering, sir,</i>

136
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,131
<i>exactly where
you've been putting your beef.</i>

137
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,178
<i>- Got blood alcohol levels?
- Phil's checking them.</i>

138
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,436
- Hello?
<i>- Hellmann's Mayonnaise.</i>

139
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,729
<i>Can you take a survey?</i>

140
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,731
- A survey?
<i>- Yes, yes. Mm-hmm.</i>

141
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,817
- About mayonnaise?
<i>- Yes, about mayonnaise.</i>

142
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,860
- I always have time for condiments.
<i>- Perfect.</i>

143
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:06,945
Ah.

144
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,488
That shower is the best.

145
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,492
No, I'm quite fastidious
about following instructions on the label.

146
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,203
Personal lubricant?

147
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,248
No, I'm not sure I understand...

148
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,093
<i>- Hello, Fujiyama.
- Quincy.</i>

149
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,471
<i>Hang on, Lieutenant,
he's right here. Quince, Monahan.</i>

150
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,602
<i>- Yeah, Lieutenant?
- Quincy, I talked to...</i>

151
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,895
Excuse me.

152
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,148
We're having some trouble with our TV.

153
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,357
Not my problem.

154
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:48,236
Not your problem?
We're guests at this hotel.

155
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,030
And our TV keeps fuzzing out.

156
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,074
It says "free TV," not "free TVs."

157
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,744
You want watch?
Go to room of another prostitute.

158
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,040
Wrong number.

159
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,961
Is the animal handler.

160
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,715
He injects his homosexual lover...

161
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,967
with venom of snake.

162
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,053
How do you know that?

163
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,347
In Soviet Union, television watches you.

164
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,894
- Is that a joke?
- You leave now.

165
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,238
Ah, Quincy, Quincy.

166
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,244
This will be my masterpiece.

167
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,413
- Okay, I can't wait.
- All right.

168
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,086
Hello?

169
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,505
Yes, is this Melanie Rosen?

170
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,965
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Melanie Danielle Rosen?

171
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:51,966
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

172
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,470
Yes, this is Lisa
from Dr. Goldberg's office.

173
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,098
We have your test results.

174
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,685
You have AIDS... in your butt.

175
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,437
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

176
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,355
Really?

177
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,692
Because I was just in my really good
friends Dawn and Stacey's room,

178
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:14,239
and suddenly, out of nowhere,
I started bleeding right out of my butt.

179
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,157
And the only way I could get it to stop

180
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:21,037
was by shoving both of their toothbrushes
into my anus!

181
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:26,793
Get a life, you fucking hags!

182
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,006
How does everyone know
my fucking real name?

183
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,800
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?

184
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,094
- My hair.
- For who?

185
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,096
For me. Self-esteem, hello?

186
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,390
I can't look at you anymore.

187
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,558
Any of you.

188
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,351
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

189
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,395
We could go out,
but we have to be back by ten.

190
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,564
Fuck.

191
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,984
Fucking cunt!

192
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,027
<i>Cunt! Cunt! Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!</i>

193
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,114
- Hi, it's Justine.
- Oh, hey. What do you want?

194
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,742
- I wanted to see if you'd split a pizza.
<i>- Again?</i>

195
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,411

00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,602
Why can't I talk to him?

00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,983
I can't order more pizza,
I'm out of cash until next Friday.

218
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,653
Good thing he wrote his number on the box.

219
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,283
Whoa.

220
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,578
Do you think
he actually wants me to call him?

221
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,084
Yeah.

222
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,713
- More! More! More!
- Ah!

223
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,973
Ruth. Up here.

224
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,059
You wanna take a field trip?

225
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,284
Guess all that extra work paid off, huh?

226
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,244
- For her, anyway.
- You wanna talk?

227
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,787
You can squat.

228
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,584
So, you have obviously been helping her.

229
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,795
You're so good, now she is so good,
and I still suck.

230
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,131
Well, Ruth takes it seriously.

231
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,593
Well, I take this seriously.
I'm working out as hard as I can.

232
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,221
I had a baby six months ago.
My hips are still in the wrong place,

233
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,766
every time Cherry makes us jump rope,
I leak a little,

234
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,267
but, you know, I'm here.

235
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,519
It's not the workouts.

236
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,730
The problem is
you think wrestling is stupid.

237
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,067
Well, it <i>is</i> stupid.
I mean, isn't it?

238
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,903
I prefer exaggerated.
I mean, that's the point.

239
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,738
My brother, he once had this promoter

240
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,698
set him up
with a guy who wrestled with a snake.

241
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,327
The day of the match, the snake died.
Kermit put on a sock puppet.

242
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,120
My brother had to wrestle it
like it was real.

243
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,415
- That sounds humiliating.
- It brought the house down.

244
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,961
Have you never been
to a real wrestling match?

245

247
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,266
Are we doing a demo?

248
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,435
Because I have this new idea
for a character...

249
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,978
No. No demos, no talking.

250
00:14:56,062 --> 00:15:00,066
It's a formality.
You guys are just window dressing or...

251
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,692
patio furniture dressing.

252
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,403
Oh, here we actually go. Sam!

253
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,614
Girls,
I'd like to introduce you to the CEO

254
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,075
and paterfamilias of this whole operation,

255
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,410
Mr. Patrick O'Towne.

256
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,994
Ah, I get it.

257
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,997
Pun. Patty O'Towne.

258
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,250
You know what they say,
our name is our destiny.

259
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,668
Yeah. Yes, so true.

260
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,670
I often wonder what my life would be like

261
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,089
if my name was,
I don't know, Francis Ford Coppola.

262
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,884
Speaking of names,
how would you like to see Patio Town

263
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,303
plastered across 14
of the most gorgeous ladies

264
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,807
in the world of wrestling?
I mean, imagine this times 14.

265
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,768
Look, I get it. Lady wrestlers.

266
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,062
Women can do anything men do,
blah, blah, blah.

267
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,188
Yeah, I appreciate it,

268
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,649
but it's not gonna help me sell
lawn chairs.

269
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,488
- I don't understand. Uh, Glen said...
- Oh, Glen. Yeah, he's a golf buddy.

270
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,781
I owed him a favor

271
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,784
for writing a recommendation letter
to Pepperdine for my son.

272
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,662
Give us a second
to show you what we're all about.

273
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,206
Look, this is a family business,
all right?

274
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,584
I mean, our customer
is a nice suburban mom

275
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,545
who's looking for a good deal
on a wrought-iron bistro set, okay?

276
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,797
Hey, enjoy the refreshments.

277
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,632
Sam?

278
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,593
What?

279
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,720
Pat.

280
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,430
Pat.

281
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:13,931
Buddy.

282
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,934
You may be selling barbecues
to moms, but...

283
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,812
I see a lot of guys here, too.

284
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,650
Guys whose lives, quite frankly,
didn't work out the way they thought.

285
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,196
Guys who are wondering
just how many more fucking sundials

286
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,365
their wives have to show 'em
before their dicks fall off.

287
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,577
You know what I'm saying, Pat?
You catch my drift?

288
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,413
Rhonda, show him what we're talking about.

289
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,835
Huh? Very nice, baby.

290
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,255
Yeah. Right?

291
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,091
This is my favorite part.

292
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,386
Calabasas homeowners,
are you ready to save?

293
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,934
I can't hear you.

294
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,315
Nyet! Nyet!

295
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,776
Stop this disgrace!

296
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,238
Patio Town...

297
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,909
is disgusting.

298
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,328
Capitalism at its worst.

299
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,746
- Should we...?
- No.

300
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,250
So much quality, so much choices.

301
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,963
One store, 50 different types of chair.

302
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,132
In Soviet Union, we have one chair.

303
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,010
We take turns to sit in him.

304
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,013
You miss your turn, too bad.

305
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,475
You sit on floor for rest of year.

306
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,980
This is the greatness of communism.

307
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,523
Boo!

308
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,196
Yeah, boo!

309
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,824
Okay, okay.

310
00:17:54,907 --> 00:18:00,705
I know why you boo.
Because so many cash register.

311
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,750
At Patio Town,
you never get to stand in line.

312
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,963
In Soviet Union,
line is like cocktail party.

313
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,259
Where else you have conversation
and KGB don't hear?

314
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,137
Here we go.

315
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,598
Yeah, all right.

316
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,494
Fuck my mother in her fucking cunt!

317
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,787
I'm thirsty!

318
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,955
Fuck you!

319
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,625
What are you looking at?

320
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,461
Oh, you guys are friends now? That's cute.

321
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,713
Are you guys going out?

322
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,467
'Cause Cherry's gonna have a shit fit
if you guys aren't back by curfew.

323
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,509
Tell.

324
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,346
Can I come?

325
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,524
Holy shit. Carmen, these are good seats!

326
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,442
I know people.

327
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,652
Hi.

328
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,079
Buckle your seat belts,
it's wrestling time!

329
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,923
Mm. Delicious.

330
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:39,220
In Soviet Union, we must pay one month's
salary for this quality of cat.

331
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,015
Mm.

332
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,809
Fosters Freeze.

333
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,228
We have same place.

334
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,271
Ice Cream Gulag.

335
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,276
There, you go in, it's so cold, you die.

336
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,866
I like you like this.
I like you more than I usually like you.

337
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,118
Mm.

338
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,121
Is because you are weak American.

339
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,457
I will destroy all you hold dear.

340
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,752
Russians, best villains since the Nazis.

341
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,797
It's too bad you can't do it for real.

342
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,590
Why can't I?

343
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,842
Well, if you're Russian,

344
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,262
you have to fight the all-American hero,
and Debbie's not talking to you.

345
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,723
Well, you never know.

346
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,808
She could change her mind.

347
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,147
Is like old Russian saying:

348
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,067
A fishermen cannot kill a chicken

349
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,403
till there are no more fish in the sea.

350
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,073
I need to wee.

351
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:42,950
So?

352
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,077
Go.

353
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,664
- Don't you want to come with me?
- What?

354
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,217
Do you normally
like to watch her wee?

355
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,970
Is that something you fancy?

356
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,389
All right, okay, shut up.

357
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,476
- You're fucking her.
- You fucked what's-his-name.

358
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,519
- He wasn't my boss.
- Right.

359
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,605
He was your best friend's husband.

360
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,697
Sorry.

361
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,491
That was defensive.

362
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,201
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,664
I have a flaw in my conflict style

364
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,959
according to my ex-wife's
cognitive behavioral therapist.

365
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,714
Why did you do it?

366
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,220
Why does anyone make a stupid,
horrible mistake?

367
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,263
Well, for me...

368
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,892
it's usually 'cause I'm high...

369
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,353
or drunk,

370
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,941
or someone has done something
to make me feel so small and insecure...

371
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,820
that I have to do something
to remind myself that I exist.

372
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,783
But you don't seem like
that kind of person.

373
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,246
What kind of person do I seem like?

374
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,957
An okay person.

375
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,218
You know, Sam and I are shagging.

376
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,163
That's it!

377
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:57,084
Watch this. Moonsault. It's one
of the hardest moves in wrestling.

378
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,756
Oh, shit! That looks dangerous.

379
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,012
- Yeah!
- Winner!

380
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,055
We should probably get going.

381
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,726
I have to check on the baby
before my mother goes to sleep.

382
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,643
One more match.

383
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,730
One of my all-time favorite guys
is up next. Please?

384
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,068
I need some tequila.

385
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,696
Yes! Mama is out!

386
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,200
I mean, does he even know my name?

387
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,661
What if I call, and I'm like,
"Hi, this is Justine."

388
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,038
And he's like, "Who?"

389
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,581
He knows your name.

390
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,000
Maybe he's been expecting me to call.
Now he's mad.

391
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,377
What if he, like, hangs up on me?

392
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,671
What if I have to talk to his mom?

393
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,635
He probably already has
a girlfriend.

394
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,595
Some cool punk girl who's in a band,

395
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,972
and knows how to give a blow job
without choking.

396
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,311
I... I didn't order pizza.

397
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,855
I did.

398
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,779
I'm going to study.

399
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,280
I'll be back later.

400
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,866
In exactly 45 minutes.

401
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,205
Try not to choke on anything. Thanks!

402
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,672
You didn't call me.

403
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,299
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,805
It's okay.

405
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,704
Yeah!

406
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,582
They call him Steel Horse.

407
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,042
A working class hero.

408
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,336
Yeah!

409
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,133
I think my vagina just swallowed itself.

410
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,177

♪ <i>Make that money </i>♪

415
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,488
The greatest showman
who has ever walked into the ring.

416
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,706
Mr. Monopoly, the heel.

417
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,000
This is gonna be a grudge match.

418
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,919
- Like, in real life?
- In the story.

419
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,505
Every match is like another chapter.

420
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,718
It started when Mr. Monopoly closed down
the factory in Steel Horse's town,

421
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,887
and he and all of his friends
lost their jobs.

422
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:59,266
And then, he kidnapped Crystal,
Steel Horse's woman, and brainwashed her.

423
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,978
She was his high school sweetheart,
but now she thinks he's evil.

424
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,440
He still loves her.
Every time, tries to win her back.

425
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,317
Come on!

426
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:09,943
Come on!

427
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,696
Come on! Come on!

428
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:15,949
I'm here for you.

429
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,409
Come on.

430
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,827
I'm right here.

431
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,789
- No, no, no. You stay right there!
- Come on! Come on!

432
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,296
It turned out
they're actually half-brothers, and...

433
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,673
And that was his plan,
to ruin Steel Horse's life

434
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,926
to get revenge
on the father who abandoned him.

435
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:37,554
Oh, my God.

436
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,639
Let's go!

437
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,225
It's a soap opera!

438
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,895
This is a soap opera!

439
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,732
I understand how to do that.

440
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,154
Come on!

441
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:08,919
Come on!

442
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:16,552
Steel Horse!
Steel Horse! Steel Horse!

443
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,185
My brother said he's super nice.

444
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,320
Hi, Dale.

445
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,447
I'm Carmen, Tom and Kurt's little sister.

446
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,615
Oh, right. Sure.

447
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,077
We just wanted to come back
and tell you how amazing that was.

448
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,330
- Um, these are my friends. Melanie...
- Melrose.

449
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,832
Melrose. Hi, it's a pleasure.

450
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,458
- Hi.
- Hi.

451
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,335
- And Debbie.
- Hi.

452
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,883
You're Laura Morgan.

453
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,344
- From <i>Paradise Cove.</i>
- Oh, yeah. Oh, God.

454
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,804
Yeah. I mean, I was.

455
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,391
I can't believe I'm meeting you,
I'm a huge fan.

456
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,184
- You watch soaps?
- Yeah.

457
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,562
It's where we get all our best ideas from.

458
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,524
But I have to say,
new Laura can't act for shit.

459
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:22,284
I sell it, but he's the one
with the real strength, the real craft.

460
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,287
That's how it is with bad guys.
They're craftsmen.

461
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,539
You mean the heel.

462
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,458
Superfan here.

463
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,878
Yeah. The heel makes the face.

464
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,422
Rick has been making me look good
for years.

465
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,257
That's a good friend.

466
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:40,302
We're not friends.
You don't have to be friends to wrestle.

467
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,639
It's like an unspoken language.

468
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,142
I look at him like this...
he looks at me like that.

469
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,480
And we know what's gonna go down.
Because that's a partnership, you know?

470
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,399
We don't like each other,
but we make each other better.

471
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,945
Shit in the ring, it's just entertainment.

472
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,114
But there's gotta be
something there that's real.

473
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,283
That's what makes it work.

474
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,953
That's what makes it hit you.

475
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,248
Right here.

476
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,172
Debbie?

477
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,301
- It's getting late.
- It's cool.

478
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,513
You probably gotta go home
to your boyfriend or husband.

479
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,308
Uh, you know what,
I am actually recently separated, so...

480
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,226
Oh.

481
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,936
Mm-hmm.

482
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,817
Debbie, don't make me be the rules person.

483
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,610
I'm not emotionally equipped for it.

484
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,612
You know what, why don't you just...

485
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,282
Just, uh... Just take my car.

486
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,158
- Are you sure?
- I'll take a cab. Yeah.

487
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,953
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Fantastic! Bye.

488
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,414
- If Cherry finds out...
- You know, I'll deal with Cherry.

489
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,748
- Really sweet of you.
- Bye.

490
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,042
- Thanks for having us.
- Yeah, yeah. Bye.

491
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,214
- Separated?
- Yeah.

492
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,259
- I feel bad for your husband.
- Really? 'Cause I don't give a shit.

493
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,563
Jesus, baby, it's five in the morning.

494
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,522
And when I get back,

495
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,567
there might actually be hot water left
for my damn shower.

496
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,114
Mm. Mm. Go run, go.

497
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,413
Fuck.

498
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,166
Shit. Where the fuck is that key?

499
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,504
Hey, Cherry.

500
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,131
Oh, good morning.

501
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,424
Hi.

502
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,636
I'm so sorry, I, uh...
Well, had a little bit of an emergency.

503
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,016
And... Well, everything's fine, but...
I'm just gonna grab my keys, and...

504
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,517
Oh... no smoking.

505
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,855
Keith thinks I quit.

506
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,610
Well, it's my first pack
since Randy was born, so...

507
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,989
So...
did Steel Horse live up to the name?

508
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,202
- They told you.
- Melrose did.

509
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,872
I told her what we do to rats where
I come from. Bitch shut up after that.

510
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,458
Yeah...

511
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,087
You didn't answer my question.

512
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,589
Oh. Um...

513
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,384
Yeah, it was good, I guess.

514
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,718
You know, it's exciting.

515
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:27,677
It's kind of...

516
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,596
So...

517
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,974
And fucking weird. I don't know.

518
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,938
You know,
you're with someone for a long time,

519
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,066
and all you think about
is all the guys you'd get to sleep with

520
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,110
if he just, like, disappeared...

521
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,320
and then he does.

522
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,281
And you do, and...

523
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,535
You just remember how much easier it is...

524
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,204
How much better everything works
when, um...

525
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,833
It's someone you really know,
and, uh, who really knows you.

526
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,336
- Sounds like horse was less than steely.
- Oh, no.

527
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,463
The horse was steely. Exhaustingly steely.

528
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,508
Steely enough
that I'm dreading having to pee.

529
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,177
So, I gotta get some sleep.

530
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,140
Enjoy.

531
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,642
Oh, no. You're not getting off that easy.

532
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,436
We've got a 5K uphill.

533
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,520
- 5K?
- Just you and me.

534
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,188
Oh...

535
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,189
Okay.

536
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,610
Give me five minutes to wash my face
and drain my tits.

537
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,903
You got until I'm done.

538
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,071
- Okay.
- Yep.

539
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,497
Dawn, enough with the fucking crank calls.

540
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:38,832
It's Debbie.

541
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,375
Oh.

542
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,462
Oh, hey. You all right? What's going on?

543
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,465
Yeah.
So, I've been thinking about the show.

544
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,549
<i>What? You know, look,</i>

545
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,969
I know that the situation
with the network executive was not...

546
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,637
ideal...

547
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:53,597
I'm all in.

548
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,100
But if you want me to be the star,
I need a great heel.

549
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,018
