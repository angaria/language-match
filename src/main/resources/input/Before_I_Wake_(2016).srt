1
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,070
I'm sorry, Cody.

2
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,490
I've had a case come
back across my desk...

3
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,580
that could be a very good fit.

4
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,080
Cody. He's eight.

5
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,040
His birth mother died
when he was three.

6
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,130
And we placed him
with a couple that...

7
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,130
may turned out weren't fit.

8
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,590
The second couple we placed
him with abandoned him.

9
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,050
- Oh, my God.
- And I went for his annual follow up

10
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,140
I found him living
alone in the apartment.

11
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,680
- Alone?
- For almost a month, we think.

12
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,980
Neighbors called once he
started going door to door.

13
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,110
Look, I like this kid.

14
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,450
We're not supposed to have
opinions like that, but I do.

15
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,700
He's resourceful, he's resilient.

16
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,340
I'm not saying these
things haven't affected him.

18
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,370
- He's guarded, he has sleep issues.
- Of course.

19
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,120
But for all he's been through,

20
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,130
he hasn't let it turn him into a
victim. But for all he's been through,

21
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,220
he hasn't let it turn
him into a victim.

22
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,680
Witch is what made me
think of the two of you.

23
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,230
Now that you've been approved,

24
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,730
I think you'll make
wonderful foster parents.

25
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,810
My question for you is...

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,110
Are you ready for this?

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,410
Okay, living room.

28
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,580
We can leave that one.

29
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,340
Are you sure?

30
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,640
Clean slate, you know.

31
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,470
Just that one.

32
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,970
Whatever it was like for her,

33
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,020
they said it was fast.

34
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,940
And she wasn't aware
of what was happening.

35
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,160
It's not nearly as bad
as I imagined in my head.

36
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,370
And I find confort in that.

37
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,460
It's very good, Jony.

38
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,670
Anyone else?

39
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,140
We have decided to bring a
child into our home tomorrow.

40
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,090
- That's wonderful, Jessie. Congratulations.
- Thank you, Peter.

41
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,930
How have you been feeling these days?

42
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,190
I still can't sleep
at night very well.

43
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,780
- You still on Ambien?
- Yes.

44
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,150
Insomnia is common.

45
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,620
Somnia is Latin for "Dreams".

46
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,550
Insomnia simply means "No Dreams".

47
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,010
And what else is a
child, but our dreams?

48
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,850
Our hopes, manifest.

49
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,980
We talked about numbness last week,

50
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,330
where something a lot of us has felt.

51
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,180
Yeah, I don't know if I'm
doing any better with that.

52
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,030
I think I'm, a little.

53
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,870
but the color hasn't returned
to the world just yet.

54
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,040
How Is Mark with this? We
haven't seen him for awhile.

55
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,080
We always say that people
processes grief differently.

56
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,760
Mark and I have had different
experiences with this.

57
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,540
- The feeling distant from a spouse is...
- Common. Yes.

58
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,390
I just wish I knew how to fix this.

59
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,090
For him, for us.

60
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,560
And I really wish he would continue
coming to group with me because...

61
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,850
it's the only time I feel...

62
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,240
I don't know...

63
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,630
Awake.

64
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,850
- You ready?
- I think so.

65
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,070
- Hey.
- Let's go say hi.

66
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,700
This is Mr and Mrs Hobsen.

67
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,490
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

68
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,040
Good morning.

69
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,380
Good morning. How are you?

70
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,210
Can I take that box for you?

71
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,880
No? Okay. Whatever
you want to do, pal.

72
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,520
Thank you. I'll take good care of it.

73
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,820
Come on, come on in.

74
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,780
Here we are.

75
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,100
You don't have to do that.

76
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,420
Shoes make floors dirty.

77
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,610
- You have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

78
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,420
It's all yours, Cody.
Nothing's out limits.

79
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,900
Yeah, come on, I'll
show you my Xbox, or...

80
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,850
or we can get a Wii, I guess.

81
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,530
I'm not sure which one you play.
But you play, though, right?

82
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,860
I think Mark's pretty excited
to have someone to play.

83
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,090
You ever played this
connect? Sports thing?

84
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,930
It's got a censor on it,
so there is no control.

85
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,970
Whatever you do, the little dude does.

86
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,290
You can swing, you can
throw, you can kick.

87
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,350
And the little guy
does it. I'll show you.

88
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,430
great. It's pretty mean.

89
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,240
It doesn't look like much.

90
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,320
We want you to decorate
it the way you like it

91
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,920
- really?
- That's right.

92
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,550
We're gonna replace those, I
just throw whatever in a basket,

93
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,990
but you can pick out
anything you want.

94
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,000
Cody collects butterflies.

95
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,670
- You do?
- Really?

96
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,660
I love this room.

97
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,420
remember, it's just the first
night. We are all in this together.

98
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,660
You okay?

99
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,430
I like your eyes.

100
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,980
Thank You.

101
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,930
They're really pretty.

102
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,710
Let's get some sleep.

103
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,130
Good night, Mrs Hobsen.

104
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,370
Good night, Cody. Sleep tight.

105
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,890
Monarch.

106
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,400
Alright.

107
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,860
Here. Alright.

108
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,290
- What's your favorite kind of pizza?
- Pineapple.

109
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,630
Yeah? That's what we're
going to have tonight.

110
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,300
Celebrate your brave day.

111
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,010
Let's go, you ready?

112
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,840
So, let's all say "Welcome, Cody".

113
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:26,850
Welcome, Cody. So, let's
all say "Welcome, Cody".

114
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,100
Welcome, Cody.

115
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,760
You can take that
seat, right over there.

116
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,230
Alright, let's open those notebooks.

117
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,230
Everyone ready?

118
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,850
The first word is...

119
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,240
Everything's right in there?

120
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,250
I'm fine. Everything's right in there?

121
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,500
I'm fine.

122
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,960
He's fine.

123
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,100
I just wanted to make
sure I can still hear him.

124
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,510
He's fine.

125
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,940
- What's this guy?
- The Blue Morpho.

126
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,350
Sounds like some kind of
superhero or something.

127
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,220
And what is this? This is
like a Cocoon or something?

128
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,390
That's a chrysalis. It keeps
them safe till they grown up.

129
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,860
So, I guess we better go to bed.

130
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,950
Alright.

131
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,800
- I'll be right there.
- Okay, sweety.

132
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,220
Hey.

133
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,830
So, I was straightening
out for you earlier,

134
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,830
and I accidentally found
some of your stimulants.

135
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,980
Stimulants?

136
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,930
Things that keep you awake.

137
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,040
- I don't like to sleep.
- I know.

138
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,870
But there's nothing for
you to be scared of here.

139
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,120
- Yes, there is.
- What?

140
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,220
The Canker Man.

141
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,760
Who's that?

142
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,280
He comes when I sleep. He eats people.

143
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,900
Well, that's no good.

144
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,340
He ate my mom.

145
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,260
You know, when I was little girl,

146
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,310
I thought there was a witch
scratching in my window.

147
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,720
But it was just a tree.

148
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,270
The branches had grown
a little too long,

149
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,460
And they hit the window
when the wind blew.

150
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,440
Ones I knew that, the
witch never came back.

151
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,010
Sometimes scary things go away
when we understand them a little.

152
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,270
Not The Canker Man.

153
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,270
Well, you're in new home now.
I'm sure he can't find you.

154
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,770
He's always with me, he says so.

155
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,560
You did what you had to do.

156
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,200
You can't let him have a sugar stash,

157
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,760
in the middle of his
room, under his bed.

158
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,700
I know, I still feel
like I was trespassing.

159
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,300
No. You're parenting

160
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,910
<i>When you came in, you said
something about a ghost?</i>

161
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,990
<i>There was something.</i>

162
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,080
<i>What did it look like?</i>

163
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,250
<i>Well, it was wearing a black thing
that went all the way to the floor.</i>

164
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,380
<i>Weren't you a little
frightened at the time?</i>

165
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,010
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

166
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,120
<i>- That, Mr. Loren,
is hysteria. - Jess.</i>

167
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,680
<i>Well, then doctor, how do you
explain what happened to Lance?</i>

168
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:27,700
<i>Was that hysteria too? Well, then doctor,
how do you explain what happened to Lance?</i>

169
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,530
<i>Was that hysteria too?</i>

170
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,390
<i>You better get that
checked in a day or two.</i>

171
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:35,400
<i>Thanks, doc. You better get
that checked in a day or two.</i>

172
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,950
<i>Thanks, doc.</i>

173
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,800
Where they come from?

174
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,920
Have you ever seen this many?

175
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,560
Do we have any jars?

176
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,930
Butterflies even come out at night?

177
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,340
Maybe there is a big pretty moths.

178
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,120
- What?
- It bit me.

179
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,560
- Butterfly bit you?
- No...

180
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,250
Where are they coming from?

181
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,120
I need a lid.

182
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,660
What the hell?

183
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,260
What the hell just happened?

184
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,590
I saw something last night.

185
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,220
I think it was Sean.

186
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,130
I know we have all had those dreams,

187
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,550
and felt like we've seen
our kids out in the world.

188
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,240
But this was different.

189
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,760
And I couldn't help but
feel that it was because...

190
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,210
Go ahead.

191
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,850
He knows about Cody.

192
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,270
And he's angry with me.

193
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,950
For replacing him?

194
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,250
Yeah.

195
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,950
We talked about something
ike this at the begining,

196
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,500
when Mark wanted to sell the house,

197
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,800
- but you refused, because...
- I felt like he was still there.

198
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,350
You said you saw him sometimes.

199
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,580
Yes.

200
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,350
Okay.

201
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,250
The thing you need to
understand about the dreams

202
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,360
you can lose at dreams, it's can
feel very real while we having them.

203
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,650
This wasn't a dream.

204
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,000
- I was awake.
- Doesn't matter.

205
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,870
If we're suppressing negative
emotions like guilt or fear,

206
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,250
especially for sleep
deprived on top of that,

207
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,470
our subconscious will figure out
a way to process those emotions.

208
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,900
Even if we're awake.

209
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,770
We can even achieve levels of
REM's sleep while we're awake.

210
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,470
It's called "a waking dream".

211
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,700
It's more common than you think.

212
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,580
Just felt very real.

213
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,470
Yeah, I'm sure it did.

214
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,880
But, waking dream,
any dreams actually,

215
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,860
are convorsation that
we're having with ourselfs.

216
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,870
Every character in your
dreams is actually just you.

217
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,270
And when we're trying to
bury uncomfortable emotions,

218
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,930
or ideas, or we feel threatened,

219
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:44,320
sometimes the only outlet
they have is our subconscious.

220
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,930
It's normal for us to feel huanted,

221
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,920
by our past, by our losses,
by the children we lost.

222
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,000
But, Jessie, know.

223
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,530
Sean is not haunting your home.

224
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,830
The question is what are you
trying to say to yourself?

225
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,730
What unresolved emotions
are strangling to get out?

226
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,570
That's pretty.

227
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,980
It's a monarch.

228
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,430
Don't they have...

229
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,800
I guess so.

230
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,360
Thank god, where did
you find him this time?

231
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,460
He's in the maintenance shed,
which will be locked from now on.

232
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,220
Oh, No. Not your seat.

233
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,390
You know where you going.

234
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,770
Is this everything?

235
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,990
I'll do sweep.

236
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,250
Hey, pal.

237
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,430
How are you doing? Are you alright?

238
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,060
Who is that?

239
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,300
Well, it's our son. His name was Sean.

240
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,720
Where is he?

241
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,300
Well...

242
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,750
He's in heaven.

243
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,920
That's where my mom is.

244
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,670
Tell me, what was she like?

245
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,460
I don't remember her.

246
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,980
How did Sean go to heaven?

247
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,570
We wish he hadn't.

248
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,090
As like I'm sure you
wish your mom hadn't.

249
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,830
He looks fun.

250
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,550
<i>Are you in fear
losing your car?</i>

251
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,600
<i>Sounds familiar?</i>

252
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:07,610
<i>If you owe more than ten thousand dollars
to the bank or the IRS, Sounds familiar?</i>

253
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,890

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,950

Look who's back.

264
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,700
where the hell they coming from?

265
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,780
No.

266
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,660
No.

267
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,980
I'm sorry.

268
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,270
He's real.

269
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,340
You saw him.

270
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,060
Touched him.

271
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,120
I did, I was right there.

272
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,650
I'm sorry.

273
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,320
Why?

274
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,810
My dream.

275
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,420
What do you mean, Cody?

276
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,150
What happens when you dream?

277
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,900
I won't do it again.
Please, don't be mad.

278
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,960
- Oh, hey. Pal, we're not...
- Honey, we're not mad.

279
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,740
I hope you have a good day, Jessie.

280
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,140
You too.

281
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,620
I wish we could've heard his voice.

282
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,650
Alright, who wants to set the table?

283
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,420
- Come on, buddy.
- Pizza!

284
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,230
- I think you have to dive into the water.
- Okay, you're... okay.

285
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,300
Okay, That's one more
round for you, buddy.

286
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,350
Hey, Cody.

287
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,180
You know, yesterday you
were asking about Sean?

288
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,720
You want to see him?

289
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,220
Yes, please.

290
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,770
When's the last time
you had a real Christmas?

291
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,720
I don't know.

292
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,310
You will this year.

293
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,230
<i>- Here he comes, here he comes.
- He's coming, he's coming.</i>

294
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,880
<i>- He came! He
came! - That's him.</i>

295
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,790
<i>Merry Christmas, baby!</i>

296
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,010
<i>What do you think?</i>

297
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,510
<i>- I think it's a train.
- Why? Did it whistle?</i>

298
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,100
<i>Oh, did Sean write train?
I don't remember...</i>

299
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,820
<i>you sent to Santa you
think about the train.</i>

300
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,850
<i>What is it?</i>

301
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,960
<i>I can't see it.</i>

302
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,340
<i>What do you think, hun?</i>

303
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,810
<i>North Pole Express. Do you
know who lives in there?</i>

304
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,720
<i>North Pole Express.</i>

305
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,410
<i>- Santa lives there.
- Yes, he lives there.</i>

306
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,490
<i>North Pole Express.</i>

307
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,170
<i>Oh my god, come on,
fight back, buddy.</i>

308
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,590
<i>You can escape.</i>

309
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,420
He used to give me Eskimo kisses.

310
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,680
You see how he does that?

311
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,860
<i>Where you going, buddy?</i>

312
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,090
That's right, you didn't
sleep well last night, right?

313
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,830
In this house it's
okay for you to relax.

314
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,500
You're home.

315
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,780
Now get some sleep.

316
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,540
I'm putting on another pot.

317
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,920
Oh, let's call it the night.

318
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,320
- he's a tough, and he needs to sleep.
- I know, baby. so do we.

319
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,220
Let's go to bed.

320
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,680
I'm going to make another pot.

321
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,890
Okay. I'll go to bed.

322
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,980
Jess.

323
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,530
Jess.

324
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,300
He came! He came!

325
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,780
I think it's a train!

326
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,020
Why? Did it whistle?

327
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,370
Cody.

328
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,230
<i>I am always with you.</i>

329
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,810
Let's go to bed.

330
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,650
What is that?

331
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,400
The Canker Man.

332
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,260
Sometimes, if I do
this, it keeps him away.

333
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,420
- Boys are home.
- Hi there.

334
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,010
Okay, go on.

335
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,510
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, I'm a little hunger.

336
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,020
Yeah? Okay.

337
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,720
Why don't you go upstairs,
and wash your hands,

338
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,470
and come back and tell
me all about your day?

339
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,760
Okay? Okay.

340
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,210
Are we going to talk about this?

341
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,460
He needs to sleep.

342
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,930
Okay, he needs to sleep.

343
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,120
Yeah, Cody needs to sleep.

344
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,410
But, Jessie, is that what it is about?

345
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,200
Or is this about Sean?

346
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,210
Okay.

347
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,240
What are you doing?

348
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,350
This feels wrong, Jess.

349
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,400
This...

350
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,800
I felt wrong...

351
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,770
when you... you puting that DVD.

352
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,310
And then...

353
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,770
It hasn'n felt right since.

354
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,890
It feels like abuse.

355
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,010
- Abuse?
- Yeah.

356
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,690
Abuse?

357
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,750
We promised to take
care of that child.

358
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:02,510
Not use him like some
home movie projector for...

359
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,680
That child needs to sleep.

360
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,060
And if he can help us heal...

361
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,150
We need to heal, Mark.

362
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,360
- He can help us heal.
- This is not healing.

363
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,370
I saw it in your face. You felt it too. -
He can help us heal. - This is not healing.

364
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,460
I saw it in your
face. You felt it too.

365
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,780
Yeah, of course.

366
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,870
If you want to go to bed, go to bed.

367
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,240
Jess.

368
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,250
I'm staying here, and I'm
waiting for Sean. Jess.

369
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,340
I'm staying here, and
I'm waiting for Sean.

370
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,010
Well, it's not our
son, and it's not Sean,

371
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,840
and it's not our son.

372
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,640
I'm not going to let you
take him away from me again.

373
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,010
Again?

374
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,310
hey.

375
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,700
I'm sorry.

376
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,870
- Again?
- I'm sorry.

377
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,830
No. Not fair.

378
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,760
It's not fair. Not fair.

379
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,680
You all set?

380
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,320
Okay, go ahead

381
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,840
You started it, Tate.

382
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,900
Thirteen plus five?

383
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,150
- Hayden?
- Eighteen?

384
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:11,160
Yes. - Hayden?
- Eighteen?

385
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,190
Yes.

386
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,490
Fifteen plus four?

387
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,370
- Hunter?
- Nineteen.

388
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,300
Good.

389
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,890
Seven plus thirteen?

390
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,220
- Clara?
- Twenty?

391
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,760
Nice.

392
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,600
Nine plus fourteen.

393
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,100
This time is fine.

394
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,060
but if you're not
feeling well for recess,

395
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:39,100
maybe you should
visit the nurses room.

396
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,610
Can I just stay here?

397
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,700
I have to step out, just for a minute,

398
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,500
Why not you put your
head down and rest?

399
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,750
Cody, what's going on?

400
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,910
Let's go home.

401
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,950
What happened?

402
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,740
A kid run away.

403
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:55,960
What?

404
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,670
He's done it before. He's a mean kid.

405
00:46:58,670 --> 00:46:58,680
Can we go home, please? He's
done it before. He's a mean kid.

406
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,520
Can we go home, please?

407
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,190
Okay.

408
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,320
You okay?

409
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,980
I'm fine.

410
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,830
Well, we didn't see
very much even the night.

411
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,610
I'm sorry, I don't feel a very well.

412
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,290
Don't feel well?

413
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,000
Let's have a look at you.

414
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,050
Worried about what
happened at school today?

415
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:37,260
Well, I think it's going to be okay,
that little boy is going to turn up.

416
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,730
- Good night.
- Good night.

417
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,690
Well, You...

418
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,400
You're going to use
some sleep too, you know?

419
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,410
I'll be in soon.

420
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,330
Okay.

421
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,620
I'm awake, this can't be hapening.

422
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,170
I'm awake, this can't be hapening.

423
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,300
No! No, no!

424
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,020
- I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I'm awake. I'm awake.

425
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,030
- I'm awake. - I'm awake. - I'm awake.
I'm awake. - I'm awake. I'm awake.

426
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,320
- I'm awake.
- I'm awake.

427
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,450
I'm awake.

428
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,020
No! No!

429
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:56,030
- No! I'm awake!
- Cody? Cody?! No! No!

430
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,110
- No! I'm awake!
- Cody? Cody?!

431
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:58,120
- No! Stop! - Cody, stop. -
No! I'm awake! - Cody? Cody?!

432
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,950
- No! Stop!
- Cody, stop.

433
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,090
- I'm awake! I'm awake!
- I got you. I got you.

434
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,620
I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I got you. Hey, I got you.

435
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:08,630
- I'm awake. I'm awake. - Oh, it's okay, baby. It's
okay. I'm awake. I'm awake. - I got you. Hey, I got you.

436
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,090
- I'm awake. I'm awake.
- Oh, it's okay, baby. It's okay.

437
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,180
I'm sick. I don't
want to go to school.

438
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,640
Sick, huh?

439
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,980
Yes, sir.

440
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:20,990
That's too bad. Yes, sir.

441
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,120
That's too bad.

442
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,480
I guess you won't be interested
in do a little shopping today.

443
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,610
Pick up some stuff for your new room.

444
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,780
I don't think I deserve to.

445
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:39,290
If there is one thing I
know, you deserve a good day.

446
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,620
- How long hasn't he slept?
- At least two days.

447
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,630
But it's been going on
since he first got home.

448
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,290
I'm giving him Zolpidem.
It's a paediatric Ambien.

449
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,120
Just a pill before bedtime
should do the trick.

450
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,130
<i>Dr. Petrom room six, one. Dr. Petrom room six, one.
Just a pill before bedtime should do the trick.</i>

451
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,630
<i>Dr. Petrom room six, one.
Dr. Petrom room six, one.</i>

452
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,250
It's just to get him started.

453
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:55,260
We can't let him stay up for days
on end. It's just to get him started.

454
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,350
We can't let him stay
up for days on end.

455
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,060
Sleep deprivation at this
age can do real damage.

456
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:02,840
Thank you.

457
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,960
- Hi.
- Hi.

458
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,840
Can I help you guys?

459
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:31,470
I'm detective Brown,
this is officer Murray.

460
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,930
We like to ask your
son a few questions

461
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,080
about an incident that
took place at school.

462
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,140
Cody, come here.

463
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,070
- Okay, screw.
- Screw.

464
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,580
- Phillips.
- Phillips.

465
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,710
Just be sure you cough or something
when you get downstairs, okay?

466
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,020
Hey, there he is.

467
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,930
- You look better.
- I feel a little better.

468
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,690
- Good.
- So, the police came by today.

469
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,360
- What they want?
- Well...

470
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:23,370
I feel a lot better. -
What they want? - Well...

471
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,790
I feel a lot better.

472
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,490
Do you want to see my race car bed?

473
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:26,500
- Race car bed?
- I was getting to that. Do you want to see my race car bed?

474
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,870
- Race car bed?
- I was getting to that.

475
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,210
I think this little kid
still hasn't shown back up.

476
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,980
So, why they came here?

477
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,930
Well, I guess they have
to rule out abduction.

478
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,050
I guess Cody saw the kid leave.

479
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,510
How did Sean die?

480
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,720
What?

481
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,390
I just wondered.

482
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,780
Hey, buddy.

483
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,450
Why not you go set the table? Okay?

484
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,660
We'll be in in minute.

485
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:40,960
Nice.

486
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,000
Like Tik Tak Tok game.
I'm playing it always.

487
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,630
- Hi.
- Hi.

488
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,220
- What do you think?
- That is orange.

489
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,300
Weren't you glad we
didn't go with fuchsia?

490
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,640
- What's this?
- Here you go.

491
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,310
Alright.

492
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:08,110
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

493
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,900
Using fork?

494
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,370
This is very civilized.

495
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:37,100
- Today was fun.
- Today was my favorite day so far.

496
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:40,350
Yeah? Mine, too.

497
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,480
Hey, listen...

498
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,610
About the question
that you asked me...

499
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:50,660
...earlier.

500
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,960
Sean drowned. It was an accident.

501
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,880
And then, we found out we
couldn't have more kids, so...

502
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,430
I'm sorry I asked about that.

503
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,590
No, no. It's...

504
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,060
You have the right to know.

505
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:16,220
It's just important to
you also to know that...

506
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:16,230
nothing like that is going to happen to you.
It's just important to you also to know that...

507
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,110
nothing like that is
going to happen to you.

508
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,760
You okay?

509
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:49,850
I don't think I am.

510
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,770
You're a great mom.

511
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,110
That kid up there...

512
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,780
He needs a great mom.

513
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,540
You need a kid. It's a perfect match.

514
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,550
We don't need anything else.

515
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,930
I know that you think you do.

516
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:31,690
And god knows there's a big
part of me it feels the same.

517
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,150
But we don't.

518
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,750
Come to bed.

519
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,970
Come to bed.

520
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,600
Okay.

521
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,980
Yes, love.

522
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,380
Sean?

523
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,460
Cody, Cody. Wake up, wake up.

524
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,010
- Wake up, hunny. Wake up!
- Mark.

525
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,600
Won't wake up.

526
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,270
He won't, for a while.

527
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,150
- What did you do?
- He's...

528
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:27,230
Cody!

529
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:31,700
Cody, Cody! Wake up!

530
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,110
Come on, wake up.

531
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,240
Get out of here!

532
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,100
She won't wake up. She won't wake up.

533
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,810
Here.

534
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,230
She's awake. She's awake.

535
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,730
I like to take your formal
statement, Mrs Hobsen

536
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,690
and then, refer you to
someone in social services.

537
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,450
- Social services?
- Why did you drug the child?

538
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,410
I...

539
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,720
gave him a sleeping pill.
His doctor prescribed it.

540
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,390
You know the whereabouts
of your husband

541
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,370
day before last around lunch time?

542
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,220
Where you taking him?

543
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,510
We have any reason to be
near of your son's school?

544
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:03,520
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Ma'am, Ma'am. We have any reason to be near of your son's school?

545
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,450
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Ma'am, Ma'am.

546
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,550
I'm sorry.

547
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:07,560
Ma'am, we have to remove the
child from the house. I'm sorry.

548
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,070
Ma'am, we have to remove
the child from the house.

549
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:11,730
- No, please.
- Ma'am, please.

550
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:11,740
You can't take him away. -
No, please. - Ma'am, please.

551
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,730
You can't take him away.

552
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,490
Natalie.

553
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,080
You haven't returned my phone calls.

554
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,040
I was at the police
station, all night.

555
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:09,760
Where is he?

556
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,560
It's not your business any more.

557
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,270
Where's your husband?

558
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,650
I don't know.

559
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,020
That's why I have to talk with Cody.

560
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,480
That's not going to happen.

561
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,980
I need to find out more about him.

562
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,550
About his dreams.

563
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,370
You've heard this before.

564
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,580
There're several great
spport groups in here,

565
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:45,630
and a few therapists who
specialize in domestic violence.

566
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,590
I want you to reach out, get
some help for your situation.

567
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,930
And I never want to see you again.

568
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,180
Yeah, I'm so able to take care of it.

569
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:35,190
- Great. Thanks.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm so able to take care of it.

570
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,730
- Great. Thanks.
- Yeah.

571
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,730
- Hi, can I help you?
- I'm here to see Whelan Young.

572
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,450
Whelan, you have a visitor.

573
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,330
Thank you.

574
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,290
What can I do for you?

575
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,830
I'm here to talk about Cody Morgan.

576
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,980
It says here that you
and your wife Katharina

577
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,860
fostered Cody for 15 months

578
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:22,030
before he was gaven to
Peter and Doris Clemens.

579
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:24,910
Wouldn't know about them.

580
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,820
They disappeared a year ago.

581
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,330
Much like your wife.

582
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,120
What are we talking about here, Miss?

583
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,580
We're talking about what
happens when he dreams.

584
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,310
I've seen it, too.

585
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,180
You have now?

586
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,610
I watched it take my husband.

587
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,690
I wouldn't say that around here.

588
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,450
They fit you for slippers.

589
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:59,400
If you don't know
what I'm talking about,

590
01:04:59,400 --> 01:04:59,410
- then I'm wasting importent time.
- Hey, wait. If you don't know what I'm talking about,

591
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:01,950
- then I'm wasting importent time.
- Hey, wait.

592
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,650
I'm sorry.

593
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:04,660
You know, I hear "you're
crazy" for so long I'm sorry.

594
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,610
You know, I hear "you're
crazy" for so long

595
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:06,620
before you start to believe it. You
know, I hear "you're crazy" for so long

596
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,540
before you start to believe it.

597
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:11,420
Please.

598
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,550
That little boy's dreams come true.

599
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,310
Real and true.

600
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,480
It's an amazing, beautiful thing.

601
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,070
But so to his nightmares...

602
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,150
They're...

603
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,300
Dangerous.

604
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:43,620
Deadly.

605
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,470
Can I get him back?

606
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,500
My husband?

607
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,340
I don't know.

608
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:01,190
Wherever that thing comes
from, it takes them with it.

609
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,340
If they exist at all,
it's only in Cody's mind

610
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:06,690
How do you know that?

611
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:11,090
Katie and I fostered
two kids before Cody.

612
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:14,600
His mother died, no other family.

613
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:19,770
He was sweet, independent.

614
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:19,780
An artist, I thought. He
was sweet, independent.

615
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,670
An artist, I thought.

616
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:25,840
Started with the butterflies.

617
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:55,330
That went on for a few weeks.

618
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,960
We though it was magical.

619
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,120
And then, Katie got sick.

620
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,750
had a bad flu.

621
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,130
And it seemed to really upset Cody.

622
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,190
And then...

623
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,550
No!

624
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,480
I'm sorry.

625
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,330
But wasn't Katie.

626
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:44,460
It was jus his impression of her.

627
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,920
That was all what was left.

628
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,260
He was too young.

629
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,180
He was too young...

630
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:02,700
to even remember her right.

631
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,610
And I hated him for that.

632
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:13,990
I know I shouldn't have, but
god help me I hated him for that.

633
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,330
But I couldn't do it.

634
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,410
I couldn't do it.

635
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,750
If I had, you're
husband would be alive.

636
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,920
That another family would be alive.

637
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,720
Maybe you can...

638
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,100
succeed where I failed.

639
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:44,100
No.

640
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:46,690
No.

641
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,870
It's the only way.

642
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,320
Thank you for your time.

643
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:53,870
And I'm sorry for your loss, as well.

644
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,850
You really want to bet your
life to an eighteen year old boy

645
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:58,120
won't have another nightmare?

646
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,960
- It's not his fault.
- It'd be a mercy.

647
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,720
Someone has to do it.

648
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:10,010
Do you know anything
about his birth mother?

649
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,760
There's nothing in the file.

650
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,640
Only that she died.

651
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,400
I assume the way my wife did.

652
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,610
The way your husband did.

653
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,110
What you hoping to find?

654
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,110
Dr. Tennant told me not to come
back without the patient file.

655
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,360
He's try to call.

656
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,690
Do you have the PID?

657
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:40,820
I don't, all I have is
a last name and a date.

658
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,330
Night nurse said he
didn't sleep last night.

659
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,210
That's two nights in a row, then.

660
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,370
That we know of.

661
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:56,540
Policy says that we can't
let him go this long.

662
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,470
I'd like to stay here with
him tonight if that's okay.

663
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,760
You signed for the
file, you can take it.

664
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:20,490
There is a PE numbere
here on the intake.

665
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:22,250
How long you keep those?

666
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:25,880
If nobody claim them, there's a
chance they're still down there.

667
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,720
No! No!

668
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,760
- Cody, its for your own good.
- Honey, it's alright.

669
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:18,840
I don't want to hurt anymore.

670
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,470
It'll take a second.

671
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,090
Good job, son.

672
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,040
It's okay.

673
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,070
A case of mine was transferred,

674
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:34,290
and I need the name of the
facility for the report.

675
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:38,330
Natalie Friedman.
F-R-I-E-D-M-A-N.

676
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,630
Provider number, 11714.

677
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,670
Cody Morgan.

678
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,380
Where is he?

679
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,110
Mommy.

680
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,440
Cody?

681
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,980
It keeps them safe.

682
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,150
Until they grown up.

683
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,240
let them go.

684
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,050
Wait!

685
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,770
I'm taking him home.

686
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,380
This is for you.

687
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:57,730
It's your mother's journal.

688
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:04,820
Your mother's name was Andrea Morgan.

689
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:08,030
And I can tell by reading this,

690
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,410
She loved you very, very much.

691
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:18,130
When you were a baby, she
noticed you're a special.

692
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,010
It was just the two of
you against the world.

693
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,400
She writes a lot about
you, and about your gift.

694
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:41,270
And how much she loved
watching you grow.

695
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:51,080
I don't think she's stopped
writing because she didn't want to.

696
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,870
I think it's because...

697
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:56,830
She got sick.

698
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:03,000
Which just happen sometimes.

699
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:12,110
These are some of your
mother's test results.

700
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:15,900
Do you see that word there?

701
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:18,780
Canker.

702
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,450
Not quite.

703
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:33,500
It's difficult to explain
what cancer is to children.

704
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,340
In terms they can understand.

705
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,350
Your mother started to look
very different, very fast.

706
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:51,800
And by the time she was
in the Intensive Care Unit,

707
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:55,030
they started looking a
foster parents for you.

708
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:00,620
But they would've brought you
in to see her one last time.

709
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,200
To say goodbye.

710
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:19,550
Her voice would've been hard to hear.

711
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,100
But I know she would've
tried to say, if she could.

712
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:27,270
The one thing she would
never want you to forget.

713
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,360
I...

714
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,620
...am always with you.

715
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:42,290
Once you got older,
you'd forget most of this.

716
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,630
And you told people the
Canker ate your mommy.

717
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,260
And as more time went by...

718
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,260
in your mind.

719
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:58,180
The Canker Man ate my mom.

720
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,730
Into your mind, Cody.

721
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:10,030
Your amazing, special
one of kind mind,

722
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,860
made him real.

723
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,660
I'm so sorry.

724
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,200
I'm so sorry.

725
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,170
I used you, like I did for Sean.

726
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:32,340
But I'll never do that again, okay?

727
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:34,540
Never.

728
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:43,140
Here we go. Here. Close to me, there.

729
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:48,490
Remember, nothing
to worry about, okay?

730
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:52,210
I'm going to be here
with you, all night.

731
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,420
Will you tell me a bedtime story?

732
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:00,210
Sure.

733
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,010
Once upon a time...

734
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:12,060
There was a special little boy...

735
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:14,810
Who needed a mom.

736
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:22,320
And there was a sad
mom she needed a son.

737
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:25,530
Is this a happy story?

738
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:28,200
I think it is.

739
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,950
Has a happy ending, anyway.

740
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:35,080
It feels like it can't.

741
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:40,920
Because there was a people going away.

742
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:45,430
No one ever really goes away.

743
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:47,760
Not completely.

744
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:53,520
Because they live in our
minds, and in our hearts.

745
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,240
In this story...

746
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:04,080
That bully from school
woke up in his bed,

747
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,160
like nothing ever happened.

748
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:11,460
And whatever made him so
sad and mean, has gone.

749
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:16,800
And that nice lady
who care for the boy,

750
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,390
she came back to her hasbund,

751
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,350
and they lived happily ever after.

752
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,820
And daddy...

753
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:40,990
Daddy got the best present of all.

754
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,630
Can those things happen?

755
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:01,760
I guess that depends on you, Cody.

756
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:06,220
You have an amazing gift.

757
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,810
Who knows what can happen as it grows?

758
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:15,450
Thanks for bringing me home.

759
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:19,920
Mom.
