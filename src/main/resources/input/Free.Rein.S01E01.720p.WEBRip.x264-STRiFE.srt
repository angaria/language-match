00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,280
[in British accent] <i>How do you do?</i>

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,200
[chuckles] [in normal voice]<i> I'm Zoe.</i>
<i>I'm 15 and...</i>

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,880
<i>Uh, guys? Guys? Wrong girl.</i>

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,120
<i>I'm the out-of-place American over here,</i>

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,000
<i>and this is England.</i>

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?</i>

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,120
This place smells of cow.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,920
[Zoe] <i>Yeah, now you come to mention it,</i>
<i>there's a definite aroma.</i>

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,920
<i>That's my little sister, Rosie.</i>

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,360
<i>She's more LA than a wannabe actor sipping
on kale juice.</i>

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,440
We've been walking for days.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Are we lost?

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,280
I know these roads
like the back of my hand. I'm not lost.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,560
[Zoe] <i>That's my mom. She's totally lost,</i>
<i>in more ways than one.</i>

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,000
- Ooh, look at that.
- [bird squawking]

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,320
Is that a buzzard?

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,080
[Zoe] <i>And that, my friends,</i>
<i>is a really big horse.</i>

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,760
- Excuse me.
- [Rosie gasps]

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,120
[Zoe] Sorry. Hope my sister didn't get
in the way of your massive horse.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,560
[Rosie] Oh!

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,120
My party shoes.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,160
Did someone say party?

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
- Gramps!
- [Frank] Zoe!

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
But how wonderful to see you!

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,920
Ah. I thought you were going to camp.
Where's your dad?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Long story.

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,960
Dad, you're not supposed to be driving.

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm not supposed to be driving a car.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
This isn't a car.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,920
- Now, who wants a lift to the house?
- [Rosie] Me.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,480
Get on the back there. Right, that's it.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Welcome home.

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Ding, ding!

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,600
[Rosie] Hit the gas, Gramps.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,120
[Maggie] Don't encourage him.

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,320
Dad, slow down!

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,880
[Zoe] <i>Things in LA</i>

Yeah, yeah. Put it down.

[Zoe chuckles]

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,480
So, what happened to Huck?

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,280
- Oh, Dad's working.
- Yeah, really hard. [chuckles]

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,080
- It's all good, though. I have his ticket.
- You'd really rather spend the summer

71
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,120
with your old grandpa than your friends?

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Yeah. They'll be there when I get back.

73
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,600
Probably.

74
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,560
Mmm. Smells good, Gramps.
What are you cooking?

75
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,120
- Rabbit.
- Mom, Grandpa's cooking Peter Rabbit.

[laughs]

77
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,800
- Couldn't you have done egg and chips?
- She should know what real food is.

I suppose it's all rehydrated tofu burgers
in LA.

Are you really going there already?

80
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,400
[Frank] I'm just saying, it'll be good
for them to spend time somewhere real.

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,160
Somewhere with a bit of soul.

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
- [Maggie] LA has soul, too.
- Oh.

83
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,360
[Maggie] If you'd get on a plane,
I could show you.

84

- [Frank] The last thing I need is LA.
- Perfect.

- [Maggie] I've looked everywhere.
- She's probably gone... ugh! For a walk.

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,696
- Rosie doesn't do walks.
- [Maggie] She doesn't know these roads.

101
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,040
- She doesn't know the dangers.
- We're getting a little hysterical.

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,240
- She's only been gone five minutes.
- Grandpa, please, not helping.

I'll go wait by the phone.

107

I'll find her. She couldn't have gone far.

108

- Is your mother always this...
- Recently, yes.

109
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,840
You're not really here to nurse
your invalid grandfather, are you?

110

- No, Grandpa.
- Thank goodness for that.

Ow. Excuse me, hi.

118

Hey, um, I don't suppose you've seen
a ten-year-old girl about yea high,

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
resembles an angry ball of glitter?

120
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,280
- You're American.
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm French.

121
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,240
Really?

123

Okay, so, you haven't seen her?

127
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
Just because she's my little sister
and she's on the loose.

128

No, but we'll keep an eye out.

Oh, well, I'm Zoe.

133
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,280
I'm staying here for the summer
at my gramps' house, over there.

134
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,080
That's right by the stables.
You should totally come and hang out.

135
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,040
You know, I'm not exactly
what you'd call outdoorsy.

136
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,680
It's not all outdoorsy.
Some of it's indoorsy.

Yeah, it's pony camp soon.

Horsesome's my word.

- I want everyone back in the yard now.

- He's been stolen. He must have been.
- You don't know that.

145
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,800
The security
in this place is utterly inadequate.

- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

- [Sam] Marcus.

150
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,000
[Zoe] <i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

151

<i>No one looks like that in real life.</i>

152
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,320
- Did I say that out loud?
- Huh?

153
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,880
Let's hope Raven comes quietly.

154
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Who's Raven?

155
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,160
- He's...
- Just a horse.

156
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,320
- [Becky] A scary horse.
- I'm really worried, Daddy.

157
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,000
He's totally out of control.

158
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,720
I'm sure your sister will be fine.

159
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
- Can I borrow this?
- [Becky] Of course.

160
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
Uh, that's my bike.

161
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Be careful.

162
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,360
That girl is the definition of horsesome.

163
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,400
It'll catch on, Jade. Just you wait.

164
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,480
[Zoe] <i>Okay, detective mode engaged.</i>

165
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,160
<i>Where would a very small,
very angry little sister hide?</i>

166
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,880
<i>Okay, let's see.</i>

167
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
<i>Pier, picturesque.</i>

168
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,800
<i>But no Rosie.</i>

169
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
<i>Woods, whole lot of trees.</i>

170
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,440
<i>No Rosie.</i>

171
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,920
[sighs]

172
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Rosie!

173
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,480
Rosie!

174
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Rosie!

175
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Rosie!

176
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
[horse galloping]

177
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,160
[whinnies]

178
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,160
Oh, God, no.

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Oh, no.

180
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,200
[whinnying]

181
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,040
Oh, no, please don't hurt her.

182
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,240
- That's the girl looking for her sister.
- Rope and sedatives now, Marcus.

183
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
Just stay very still!

184
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,680
[Zoe] No, no, no. Okay.

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,880
You must be Raven. Okay.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,480
[whinnies]

187
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,720
It's okay, it's okay.

188
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
It's okay.

189
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,160
- Shh, shh, shh.
- [snorts]

190
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,440
Okay, okay, okay. Relax, relax.

191
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
It's all okay.

192
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
It's okay.

193
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
Wait, wait, wait. Look.

194
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,520
I've never seen him so calm.

195
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,880
Rough day, huh?

196
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,600
Yeah. Yeah.

197
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,560
Just stay very still.

198
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,920
- [whinnies]
- Hey, hey, no, no.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,440
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Here.

200
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,640
Stop it, don't be like that.
Your friends are here to take you home.

201
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,640
- [whinnies]
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey,

202
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,760
Britain's Next Top Model...
I don't think he likes that pointy thing.

203
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,640
- Easy, Miss America. It's just a sedative.
- We just need to get him under control.

204
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,000
- [whinnies]
- [Zoe] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

205
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,560
He <i>was</i> under control.

206
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,480
No needles. No sedatives. Just back off.

207
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,320
[whinnying]

208
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,600
I said, back off.

209
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,480
Okay, I get it, I get it.
You like to be free. I get it.

210
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
What's your name?

211
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,760
- Zoe.
- [Sam] Okay, Zoe.

212
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,440
Raven seems to really like you.

213
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,800
Could you help us
get him back to the stables?

214
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,680
Uh, look, I would love to help you
with your scary horse,

215
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,280
I really would,
but I need to find my sister.

216
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,960
Thing is,
it's kind of you or the sedative.

217
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,560
Listen. If you help us out,
we'll help you find your sister.

218
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,760
- Okay, what do you want me to do?
- We need to get this rope clipped on him.

219
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,320
- [whinnying]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, shh.

220
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,200
Okay, okay.

221
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,000
Hey. Okay.

222
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
[snorting]

223
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,680
Oh, hey, hey. Shh, shh. Come here.

224
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,280
That's great. We need you
to walk him back to the stables,

225
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,800
and we'll be right behind you.
If he does anything, we are right there.

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,240
Okay, okay. All right.

227
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Okay.

228
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,280
Shh. It's okay, it's okay.

229
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,160
Couple of horse thefts on the mainland.
It could be related.

230
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,400
[Mia] Horse thieves?

231
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,880
- I knew it.
- He only said it could be.

232
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,400
It must have been a gang.

233
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,760
It'd take at least four men, four big men,
to control that horse. He's utterly wild.

234
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
[Mia] Daddy.

235
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
[Becky] This is so going on my blog.

236
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,440
Thank you so much, Zoe.
We've got it from here.

237
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,000
[Marcus] Ted, can you give me a hand?

238
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,640
[Ted] Steady, boy.

239
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Steady, boy.

240
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,880
[Sam] Take him to the stables
and get him checked over.

241
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,840
[Zoe] <i>See you soon... I guess.</i>

242
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
[Sam] Okay, everyone, show's over.
Let's get back to work.

243
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,160
- It was a false alarm, Officer.
- It's Derek.

244
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,720
- [Sam] I'm so sorry to waste your time.
- No time wasted.

245
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,240
It's always good to see you.
I mean, to see the yard.

246
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,760
Although I'd advise a review
of your alarms and CCTV.

247
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
We'll look into it.

248
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,320
Yes, you will.

249
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,440
[sighs]

250
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,000
How's my favorite horse whisperer?

251
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm okay. I just need to find my sister.

252
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Right, of course.

253
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,120
Girls.

254
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,360
Wait, wait, wait.

255
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,640
These are Rosie's.

256
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,880
She's not out there. She's in here.
Somewhere.

257
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,560
[Zoe] <i>Seriously, I'm like some kind</i>
<i>of wilderness tracker, right?</i>

258
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,440
We'll help you look.
We know all the best hiding places here.

259
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,920
- Thanks, girls.
- We were playing hide-and-seek once,

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,480
and I got stuck in a Portaloo.

261
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,640
- I thought she'd gone home.
- I was in there for six hours.

262
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,400
I got the best photo of you and Raven.
Totally posting it.

263
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,600
"Mysterious Frenchwoman
hypnotizes crazy horse."

264
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,720
I didn't hypnotize him.

265
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,320
[Jade] And she's not French.

266
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,856
- [Becky] It's still huge.
- [Jade] Rosie?

267
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,000
Raven's the wildest horse in the yard.

268
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,320
What's his problem?

269
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,120
No one knows for sure.

270
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,320
He never lets anyone close enough
to find out.

271
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
[Jade] Rosie?

272
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Apart from you.

273
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,400
Maybe he's your destiny.

274
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
- [Jade] Rosie, are you in here?
- Maybe.

275
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
Rosie, are you...?

276
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Oh.

277
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Hey, boy.

278
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,480
This really isn't
a very good hiding place.

279
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,800
- Raven's in here, for starters.
- It's okay. It's okay, it's just me.

280
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,240
We should probably go.

281
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,080
- Careful.
- It's okay.

282
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,360
So, I'm looking for my little sister.

283
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
She's a runaway, like you.

284
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,840
Here. See if he wants one of these.

285
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,320
Ah, so, that's how you brought Raven home.

286
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,120
- You bribed him with sweets.
- Told you it'd be something like that.

287
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
I mean, it is pretty impressive.

288
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,120
You know, you are the talk of the yard.

289
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,280
- [chuckles] I am?
- I'm Mia.

290
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,440
- I hope these two aren't bothering you.
- No, no, they're cool.

291
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,440
We were helping her look for her sister.

292
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,120
- I suppose you think Raven's eaten her.
- Of course not. [chuckles]

293
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,960
- Have you?
- [Mia] Run along.

294
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,160
I can take things from here.

295
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,160
My dad practically owns the stables.

296
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,760
[Susie] We can show you
how things really work around here.

297
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,480
- Take my number. We should hang out.
- Oh.

298
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,200
Are you two still here?

299
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
[Jade] Bye, then.

300
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,360
- I hope you find your sister.
- Wait, wait.

301
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,120
Uh, you know, my phone died.

302
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,600
- Oh.
- Yeah, it does that sometimes.

303
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,840
Especially when people are being mean.

304
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
- I don't think I get your meaning.
- No, I think you do.

305
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Suit yourself.

306
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,840
Oh. Uh...

307
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,880
Girls, would you mind staying away
from <i>my </i>horse?

308
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,480
He's had such a crazy day.

309
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,600
Raven is your horse?

310
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,800
That's right, he's mine.

311
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
But don't worry,

312
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,680
there are plenty of other horses
in the stables suitable for tourists.

313
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,800
[whinnies]

314
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,280
I can send you that photo,
so you have something to remember him by.

315
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,200
Oh, thank you.

316
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,040
We'll have to go to the haystack.
The Wi-Fi's strongest there.

317
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,200
You guys have Wi-Fi?

318
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
[dance music playing on headphones]

319
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,640
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

320
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,560
Hey, sis.

321
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,920
I was just texting Angela and she said
that they're having a really good time.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We thought a wild horse
had run off with you.

323
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,240
A wild horse? Get a grip, sis.

324
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,080
- You found her, then?
- [Zoe] Yes. Now we're leaving.

325
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Why the rush?

326
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,600
Hi, my name's Rosie,
but you can call me Rosie.

327
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,840
- Or just call me.
- [chuckles]

328
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Ignore her. Home. Now.

329
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,680
- Call me.
- I'll see you around.

330
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,200
Oh, my God.
Hot Marcus totally looked at your face.

331
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,360
Don't most people look at your face
when they're talking to you?

332
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,080
I'd steer clear if I were you.

333
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,560
Mia's basically cocked her leg
and peed on him.

334
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,200
- That's disgusting.
- Excuse me.

335
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,120
What happened to "Home. Now"?

336
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,320
I'm coming.

337
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,200
Thank you guys so much.
I'll see you later.

338
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Wait.

339
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,920
Um, just wondering... Maybe not.

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,640
You've probably got way better offers...

341
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,520
- She's asking for your number.
- Oh.

342
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,440
You told Mia your phone was dead.

343
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
Give me them digits.

344
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
[keys jingling outside]

345
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,880
Make sure you put all the sedatives
back in the medical cabinet.

346
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,560
- Can't afford to buy more right now.
- Yeah, of course.

347
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,960
- Luckily, we didn't have to use any today.
- I know. Thanks to that girl.

348
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,840
- Zoe.
- Right.

349
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,120
- I still can't get over it.
- I know, she was amazing.

350
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,400
I put Raven in the field.
He was going crazy in his stable.

351
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,480
I'll bring him in before it gets dark.
Better safe than sorry at the moment.

352
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,480
[Zoe] <i>Mom was really worried.</i>

353
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,520
[Rosie] Mom gets worried
if I walk under a ladder.

354
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,640
[Zoe] Just because you can't get Wi-Fi,
doesn't mean you can go off and disappear.

355
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,000
You know I feel funny
when I can't get online.

356
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,640
You are not a baby, Ro.

357
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,920
Then stop treating me like one.

358
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,960
Dad chose not to come with us, didn't he?

359
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,600
No, he had work. You know that.

360
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,560
- He's busy.
- Whatever.

361
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,720
As soon as we get to Grandpa's,
I'm Googling the Constitution.

362
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
[Zoe] What the...?

363
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,840
- What?
- Nothing.

364
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
I'm wondering
why you didn't use the gate.

365
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
Spying, are you?

366
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,880
Spying? No, I'm not spying.
I'm just passing.

367
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
- I'm staying with my grandpa.
- I know.

368
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,880
Hmm.

369
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Have a look.

370
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,000
- What?
- You obviously think I'm up to something.

371
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,960
So, go on. Have a look.

372
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,640
- No, thanks.
- Suit yourself.

373
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,920
[Zoe] <i>Mysterious bags</i>
<i>and boys coming out of bushes.</i>

374
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,000
<i>Ah, this place has got it all.</i>

375
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,040
Looks like Frank's got guests up
at the house.

376
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,680
- A woman and...
- The girl who brought the dark horse in.

377
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,680
- There's something about her.
- Ah.

378
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,480
- The way she handled Raven, I mean...
- [sighs]

379
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,400
She's different.

380
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,200
A girl like that will break your heart
given half a chance.

381
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,920
- Who said I'd give her a chance?
- I mean it, son.

382
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,840
- Leave well alone.
- What's it to you?

383
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,200
Her family are trouble.

384
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,480
You think everyone's trouble.

385
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,200
Don't say I didn't warn you.

386
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,480
[Maggie] Right, that's one
very grubby daughter in the bath.

387
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,480
- Where exactly did you find her?
- The stables.

388
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,520
- The stables?
- [Zoe] Mm-hmm. Yeah, they had Wi-Fi.

389
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,880
[chuckling] Poor you, having to deal
with a bunch of pony princesses.

390
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,800
No, they weren't...

391
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,200
Tomorrow I'll go into the village
and set Grandpa up with the Internet.

392
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,080
Oh, no. I don't need you coming over here,
bringing all your new-fangled LA ideas.

393
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,880
[laughs] It's not an LA thing.
It's the whole world.

394
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,120
- It's about time you caught up.
- [sighs]

395
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,640
[Rosie] Mom,
where's my strawberry glitter shampoo?

396
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,520
So, you liked the stables, then?

397
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,040
Yeah, yeah, I did.

398
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,960
[Frank] Bright Fields is a good place.

399
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
I just hope young Sam can keep it going.

400
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,800
- Mom doesn't seem to think much of it.
- [mutters]

401
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,520
Maggie's always been more of a city girl.

402
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,720
- [alarm ringing]
- Oh.

403
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,520
[phone chimes]

404
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
[chuckles]

405
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,040
Now, where were we?

406
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,680
[Maggie] What are you doing up here?

407
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,320
This better be good. I'm about to dive
into a world of knights and ghosts and...

408
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,320
Vampire cats?

409
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,440
<i>Myths and Legends.</i>

410
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,320
I used to love that book
when I was your age.

411
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
[sighs]

412
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
I wanted to say thank you for today.

413
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,400
You've been a star.

414
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,680
- I'm sorry for being such a...
- Massively overprotective drama queen?

415
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,280
I was gonna go with "concerned mom."

416
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,440
[Zoe chuckles]

417
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,080
Having Rosie to chase round the island
will give you something to do this summer.

418
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,360
Mm, right after I come up with new
and interesting ways to lie about Dad.

419
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,800
- I'm sorry, Mom...
- It's okay.

420
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,440
Your dad and I just need a bit
of time apart to figure out...

421
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,160
where we're going wrong.

422
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,280
Yeah. Yeah.

423
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Enjoy the book.

424
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Thank you.

425
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,520
[Zoe] <i>And now, finally,</i>
<i>the total peace and quiet can begin.</i>

426
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,560
<i>No more panicking moms,
no more lost sisters,</i>

427
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,920
<i>and no more dangerous wild horses.</i>

428
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,120
[horse nickers]

429
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,160
[Zoe] <i>I said, no more wild horses.</i>

430
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,000
[horse nickers]

431
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,440
[Zoe] <i>Check me out, totally resisting.</i>

432
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,080
<i>Nope, mnh-mnh, not interested.</i>

433
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,800
[horse neighs]

434
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,920
[Zoe] <i>Ah... who am I kidding?</i>

435
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Hey.

436
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Hey.

437
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,440
Hey, boy. Hey.

438
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,600
I just wanted to come
and say good night.

439
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
We're famous.

440
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
[lens whirs]

441
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,800

[Raven snorts]

443
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,800
Hey. What's wrong?

444
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,160
Is someone there?

445
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Hey.

446
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,000
Tch. It's okay. It's just you and me.

447
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,560
There's nothing to be scared of.

448
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
I promise.

449
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
[shutter clicking]

450
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,560
