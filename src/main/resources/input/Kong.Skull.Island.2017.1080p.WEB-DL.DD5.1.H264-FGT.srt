1
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:19,979
<i>If we can put this tremendous
machine of ours...</i>

2
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,482
<i>...which has made this victory possible...</i>

3
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:24,467
<i>...to work for peace...</i>

4
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:28,002
<i>...we can look forward to the greatest
age in the history of mankind.</i>

5
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:39,982
<i>Speed of progress in the satellite project...</i>

6
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:44,770
<i>...cannot be taken as an index of
our progress in ballistic missile work.</i>

7
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:52,176
<i>I feel we're on the brink of an area of
expansion of knowledge about ourselves...</i>

8
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:56,405
<i>...and our surroundings that is beyond
description or comprehension at this time.</i>

9
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:03,205
<i>For the first time,
we're putting cameras into space...</i>

10
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:05,341
<i>...and looking down on the Earth...</i>

11
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:09,794
<i>...allowing us to discover places
and things we've never seen.</i>

12
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:15,150
<i>The most intelligent inhabitants
of that future world...</i>

13
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,254
<i>...won't be men or monkeys.
They'll be machines.</i>

14
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:23,192
<i>We set sail on this new sea...</i>

15
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:26,162
<i>...because there is new knowledge
to be gained.</i>

16
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:28,331
<i>Whether this new ocean...</i>

17
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:30,432
<i>...will be a sea of peace...</i>

18
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:34,085
<i>...or a new terrifying theater of war.</i>

19
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:38,841
<i>"To tame the savageness of man...</i>

20
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:42,428
<i>...and make gentle the life of this world."</i>

21
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,846
<i>Let us dedicate ourselves to that.</i>

22
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:00,267
<i>Stop the war! Stop the war!</i>

23
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:05,167
<i>As citywide protests have brought
congressional committee hearings...</i>

24
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:09,237
<i>...to a standstill promising more gridlock
in the days and weeks ahead...</i>

25
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:11,172
<i>...the Beltway is experiencing significant...</i>

26
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:15,681
Mark my words. There'll never be
a more screwed up time in Washington.

27
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,773
But we can't let it stop us.

28
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:23,368
Come on already, let's go!

29
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:25,587
Get out of the way!

30
00:05:25,687 --> 00:05:27,522
Maybe now's not the best time to ask.

31
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:31,359
Monarch is on the cusp of being
shut down, Brooks. We're broke!

32
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:34,712
When this war ends, we'll never
get approval for our expedition.

33
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,301
I'm not confident in our presentation.

34
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:42,571
I mean, all of our materials are loose leaf.

35
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:46,641
In one day, one day, I could have had
all of this organized and bound.

36
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:51,596
<i>...that we, today, have concluded
an agreement to end the war...</i>

37
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:54,065
<i>...and bring peace with honor in Vietnam.</i>

38
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,702
<i>All American forces will be withdrawn.</i>

39
00:05:56,852 --> 00:06:00,055
We don't have a day. Hello, there.

40
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:03,758
- Bill Randa here to see Senator Willis.
- Of course, Mr. Randa.

41
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:08,062
I left you a message this morning
about rescheduling today's appointment.

42
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:11,416
But he should have something
available in the coming weeks.

43
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:16,283
- Oh, God.
- Al, you're looking well.

44
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:18,808
So you didn't get the message, Randa?
To reschedule?

45
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:22,810
For the fifth time?
I must've missed it. It'll be quick.

46
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,247
Okay, don't get comfortable. You got
five minutes. I'm late for a meeting.

47
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:30,034
So, what imaginary monster
are you hunting this time?

48
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:34,475
This is a satellite photo of an uncharted
island in the South Pacific.

49
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:37,985
It has defied discovery until now.

50
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:41,862
Many civilizations spoke of it in legends.

51
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:44,115
Skull Island.

52
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:47,301
The land where God did not finish creation.

53
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:51,631
It's notorious for the number of ships
and planes that have gone missing there.

54
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:54,993
Like the Bermuda Triangle?

55
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:59,498
Or like that aluminum foil hat
that I like to wear on the weekends?

56
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:02,133
It's more like the triangle than the hat...

57
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,936
...but we like to think
it's much more than that.

58
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:08,606
The 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear tests...

59
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:12,110
...weren't tests.
They were trying to kill something.

60
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,081
I believe there's an ecosystem out there
the likes of which we can't imagine.

61
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:20,367
And the place to find it is this island.

62
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:23,721
A place where myth and science meet.

63
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:26,840
Randa, it's a fairytale.

64
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:34,665
Harry Truman didn't think so
when he funded Monarch in 1946.

65
00:07:34,765 --> 00:07:36,617
You know, in terms of sheer waste...

66
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:39,636
...Monarch ranks right up there
with the search for alien life.

67
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:42,221
Yeah, but those guys are nuts.

68
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:47,298
- We should have shut you down years ago.
- This is an opportunity for our country.

69
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:50,548
Listen, Senator, Landsat is sending
a mission to the island.

70
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:53,420
We could piggyback on that operation.

71
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,447
- With your permission, of course.
- What're you hoping you'll find?

72
00:07:56,547 --> 00:08:00,480
Resources, medicine, the cure for cancer,
geological discoveries.

73
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,395
I mean... possible alternate fuels.
Senator, look, just...

74
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:07,897
Listen, to be honest,
we don't know for sure what's there.

75
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:10,032
Okay? But I will tell you what we do know.

76
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,935
Tomorrow night, the Russian Novosat
passes over this sector.

77
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,581
And in three days, they're gonna
have the same images we have. So...

78
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:22,095
...whatever's there,
you want us to find it first.

79
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,397
Right?

80
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:30,954
I don't believe I'm saying this,
but that almost made sense.

81
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,489
Thank you.

82
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,424
So, I will get the piggyback for you. I will.

83
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:39,230
But listen to me, listen to me.
This is it. It's gotta end. This is it.

84
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,050
You promise me? Last favor? Okay?

85
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,902
Senator?

86
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:48,821
One last thing.

87
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:52,792
I'm going to need a military escort.

88
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:14,566
<i>Attention, all soldiers and base personnel.</i>

89
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:18,672
<i>Final troop withdrawal will commence at 0600.</i>

90
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:22,973
<i>Pack your bags, ladies. We're going home.</i>

91
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:24,175
- Hey, Mills.
- Yeah?

92
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:26,942
How many letters did you end up writing her?

93
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,652
- Ten, fifteen.
- How many did she write you?

94
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,780
I don't know, three, four.

95
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,551
Man, you got a shitty mom.

96
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:38,320
Thank you, Cole,
for clearing that up. Thank you.

97
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,422
I'll be sure to tell her
when I see her in the next 48 hours.

98
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:42,659
Yeah, you might have a shitty mom.

99
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,793
Right?

100
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:09,652
Sir?

101
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:11,430
Chapman.

102
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:14,505
You need anything, sir?

103
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:18,005
- All good.
- Roger that.

104
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:22,185
So what're you gonna do when you
get back to the world, Chapman?

105
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:25,368
I'm already set up with Eastern Air Lines.

106
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:28,552
Grace and Billy all moved in
in Atlanta, just...

107
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:32,757
...waiting on me. What about you, sir?

108
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,595
- All this for what?
- Sir?

109
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:42,201
Get out of here, Chapman. Go have some fun.

110
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,237
Is everything okay?

111
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:47,626
Tip-top.

112
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,024
Colonel Packard!
There's a phone call for you.

113
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:10,693
- This is Packard.
- <i>Packard, it's General Ward.</i>

114
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:14,984
- <i>You and your boys up for one last op?</i>
- I would not be opposed to that, sir.

115
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:18,988
<i>Your orders to head home are already processed.
Sure you don't wanna take some time?</i>

116
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:21,524
I'm here to execute
whatever orders I'm given, sir.

117
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:23,128
<i>Don't get too excited.</i>

118
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:27,129
<i>Bunch of scientists called Landsat
discovered a new island on their satellite.</i>

119
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,565
<i>They need helicopter transport
for a survey job.</i>

120
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:32,852
Roger that. And, sir?

121
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:34,436
<i>Yes?</i>

122
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:36,370
Thank you.

123
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,449
Randa, I don't get it.
You already got us a military escort.

124
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:52,788
- Why do we need a tracker? And why SAS?
- Former SAS. No allegiance to anyone.

125
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:55,825
And he rescued 12
downed pilots in Danang, in '72.

126
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:58,594
But your source says that he spends
most of his waking hours...

127
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:00,262
...in some back alley watering hole.

128
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:03,298
Is your Yale degree supposed to
lead us through the jungle, Brooks?

129
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:06,401
Besides, my father told me never
to judge a man by where he drinks...

130
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:10,292
...only how he holds it.
You on board with me here?

131
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,360
You go.

132
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,284
Well. Okay.

133
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:24,888
So... how much do we tell him?

134
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,656
Just enough to get him to say yes.

135
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:02,306
Now there's a man worth talking to.

136
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:07,830
An uncharted island?
Let me list all the ways you're gonna die.

137
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,628
Rain, heat, mud,
disease carrying flies and mosquitos.

138
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:14,236
Sure, you could load up
on the atabrine for the malaria...

139
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,754
...but what about the other bacteria?

140
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:19,874
And we haven't even started on
the things that want to eat you alive.

141
00:13:19,974 --> 00:13:24,146
- We'll double that.
- You have no idea how dangerous this is.

142
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:26,280
I want five times that.

143
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,834
Plus, a bonus if we make it back.

144
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,135
If?

145
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:38,355
Pay him. I mean, I think Mr. Conrad
should be fairly compensated.

146
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,797
Here's to profit during peacetime.

147
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:43,731
One question.

148
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:46,301
You came here looking for a tracker.

149
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:49,503
Who or what am I tracking?

150
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:52,074
This is all the information that we have.

151
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:55,376
Okay? There is no map. Only satellite images.

152
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:57,948
So we need someone like you,
with your skill...

153
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:00,890
...your unique expertise
in uncharted jungle terrain...

154
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,552
- ...to lead us on our ground expedition.
- We're just scholars and scientists.

155
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:09,478
We need someone with experience.
In case things go sideways.

156
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:13,827
Men go to war in search
of something, Mr. Conrad.

157
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:16,664
If you'd found it...

158
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:19,182
...you'd be home by now.

159
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:41,622
- Weaver.
- <i>Yeah, it's Jerry.</i>

160
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:44,192
Hey, Jerry. So, tell me, did I get it?

161
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:47,928
- <i>That Landsat thing? You got it.</i>
- I did?

162
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:51,699
<i>Hello? It's the Athena, docked in Bangkok.</i>

163
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,285
<i>Pier 14, 6:00 tomorrow night.</i>

164
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:58,676
1800 tomorrow.
Thank you. I really owe you one.

165
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:01,543
<i>I don't get it. Why do you want
a gig documenting a mapping mission...</i>

166
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:04,712
- <i>...when you're up for the cover of Time?</i>
- Jerry, when three sources tell you...

167
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:08,100
...the same thing word for word,
you know they're lying.

168
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,919
<i>There's something going on here,
something that nobody is talking about.</i>

169
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:37,489
I can't believe we're doing this.
Are you guys kidding me? A day away.

170
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:39,731
One day away!

171
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:44,252
And, no, now we gotta go to another
island with another jungle.

172
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:46,753
Vietnam's not an island, dumbass.

173
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:50,557
Well, Key West is, and that's exactly
where I need to be right now...

174
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:53,708
- ...with a drink in my hand.
- Key West ain't an island either...

175
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,680
...it's a key.

176
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,100
You ain't funny, Cole.

177
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:13,013
Mason Weaver, photographer.

178
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:15,990
Mason Weaver is a woman?

179
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,034
Last time I checked.

180
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:24,106
Can I help you?

181
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:30,060
Two years in country. Where you been?

182
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,067
- Embedded with MACV-SOG.
- You were in the shit.

183
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:39,175
I respect that. But it's people
like you lost us support back home.

184
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:43,276
You're not actually gonna blame the people
without guns for losing the war, are you?

185
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:46,046
Camera's way more dangerous than a gun.

186
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:49,303
And we didn't lose the war, we abandoned it.

187
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,389
Right.

188
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:02,930
Hello and welcome. I'm Landsat
Field Supervisor, Victor Nieves.

189
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,067
This is my colleague,
Steve Woodward, our data wrangler.

190
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:11,450
Our expedition takes us to a place every
nautical trade route known to man...

191
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,525
...has avoided for centuries.
As our satellites show...

192
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,945
...the island is surrounded
by a perpetual storm system...

193
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:22,714
...allowing it to remain hidden
from the outside world.

194
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:25,518
But with Colonel Packard's
helicopter transport...

195
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:28,654
...we will be the first to
break through to the other side.

196
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:31,259
We're also pleased to be joined,
for the first time...

197
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,627
...by the resource exploration team
led by Mr. Randa...

198
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:40,367
...and accompanied by biologist, Miss San,
and geologist, Mr. Brooks.

199
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:45,105
Our focus will be on the island's surface,
theirs, what lies beneath.

200
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:47,607
- Mr. Brooks.
- Simple, really.

201
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:50,393
We'll use explosives to shake
the earth and create vibrations...

202
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:53,246
...helping us to map
the subsurface of the island.

203
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:56,515
We'll fly in over the south shore, and
then strategically drop seismic charges...

204
00:17:56,615 --> 00:17:58,851
...to better help us understand
the density of the earth.

205
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:01,036
You're dropping bombs?

206
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:04,488
- Scientific instruments.
- You hear that, boys?

207
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:06,359
We're scientists now!

208
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,494
You guys are not scientists.

209
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:14,300
We'll then land and make base camp
for ground excursions led by Mr. Conrad.

210
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,680
- Major Jack Chapman.
- All right.

211
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,547
Once on the island, the storm's interference
will block all radio contact with the ship.

212
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:23,109
That means we'll be by ourselves.

213
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:26,946
Three days later, the refuel team will
meet us here, on the north end of the island.

214
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:30,970
That may be our only safe departure window
for an unknown period of time.

215
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,552
So, tip for everybody...

216
00:18:33,652 --> 00:18:35,691
...don't miss it, please.

217
00:18:57,543 --> 00:19:01,614
- What are you doing down here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

218
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:05,365
Why does a geological
mapping mission need explosives?

219
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:09,539
You weren't listening in class.
Seismic charges for the geological survey.

220
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:12,858
- You believe that?
- I didn't say that.

221
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,029
- Have you met Colonel Packard yet?
- Yeah.

222
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:18,064
The guy's wound pretty tight.

223
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:21,967
Well, the man's a decorated war hero.
That's the package they come in.

224
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,969
And you?

225
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:27,372
Isn't shooting a mapping mission
a step down for a photojournalist?

226
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:31,210
- The right photo can help shape opinions.
- And win you a Pulitzer.

227
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,580
Okay, Captain Conrad. What about you?

228
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,349
How did British special forces
get dragged into this?

229
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:39,884
Just "Conrad." I'm decommissioned.

230
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:43,924
- They offered me money.
- You don't strike me as a mercenary.

231
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,508
You don't strike me as a war photographer.

232
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:48,660
Anti-war photographer.

233
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:11,951
What you writing there, Chap?

234
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:13,901
Letter to my boy.

235
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,422
"Dear Billy. I know I said
I'd be home by your birthday...

236
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:21,643
...but I lied straight to your face.
I'm a terrible dad.

237
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:23,945
I hope this letter makes up for it."

238
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,067
That's too short.

239
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,694
This storm looks a lot nastier in person.

240
00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:58,464
Maybe we should consider
postponing the mission.

241
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:01,920
- How far away is this island?
- 50 miles, maybe more.

242
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,216
- Take us closer.
- You wanna launch, you do it from here.

243
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:08,105
Can you punch through that, Colonel?
Our opening is now.

244
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:11,077
- Through this hole right here?
- Yeah, it's a rare low-pressure pocket.

245
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,844
I appreciate your passion, Randa...

246
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:16,253
...but as Field Supervisor of the
controlling agency, I say we abort.

247
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:18,051
That's it, we're gonna abort.

248
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:22,104
Wise call. I'm sure the Landsat inspector
will be inspired by your courage.

249
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:25,490
No, he'll be inspired by my common sense.
This is only a map survey.

250
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,192
To one of the last uncharted areas
on the face of the Earth.

251
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:31,362
And you wanna call it on account of rain?
Stay on the boat if you want to.

252
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:34,699
It could be years before
we get another shot at this.

253
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,180
I'm told your unit is capable
of handling inclement weather, Colonel.

254
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,640
Why don't we leave it to
Colonel Packard to break the tie?

255
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,173
There is no way
I'm getting on that helicopter.

256
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,953
We did ask to arm those helicopters.
Shouldn't they know why?

257
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:57,722
Why? And raise an alarm?

258
00:21:57,822 --> 00:22:00,240
Purely a precaution, Brooks.

259
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:04,796
- Right.
- <i>Two mikes till launch.</i>

260
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:08,949
<i>Troops and civilians, board assigned
aircraft. Two mikes till launch.</i>

261
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,477
What's the old man getting us into, Cole?

262
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:23,114
Nothing he wouldn't do himself.
He's taking the lead.

263
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:26,685
I mean, doesn't he miss his bed?
I miss my bed! Don't you miss your bed?

264
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,337
Do you even have a bed, Cole?

265
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:33,366
You got a bed, right?

266
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:37,595
- See you at the rendezvous, Chapman.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:56,646
<i>Complete FOD walkdown and clear the deck.</i>

268
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:58,048
<i>One mike to launch.</i>

269
00:22:58,148 --> 00:22:59,203
- Battery?
- Check.

270
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:01,248
- Generator start?
- Check, check.

271
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:04,170
- Engine start?
- Check three times.

272
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:07,625
<i>This is Fox Leader to Fox Group.</i>

273
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:11,461
It is time, once again,
for the Griffin and ant show.

274
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:16,571
<i>As usual, remember, hold on to your butts!</i>

275
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:22,172
<i>Attention, pilots.
You are cleared for takeoff.</i>

276
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:24,925
<i>Launch, launch, launch.</i>

277
00:23:44,928 --> 00:23:46,813
<i>Combat formation.</i>

278
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:49,098
Keep visual.

279
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:52,017
Fox Five, let me know when you close.

280
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:56,207
Fox Five is in the slot.

281
00:23:56,307 --> 00:23:57,774
Roger that.

282
00:23:57,874 --> 00:24:01,360
<i>Fox team, form up on me. Keep it together!</i>

283
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:07,921
<i>Let's do this!</i>

284
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:18,679
<i>Maintain course.</i>

285
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,736
<i>Nothing we haven't done before.</i>

286
00:24:21,698 --> 00:24:23,532
"Dear Billy.

287
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:26,569
<i>"You ever looked into
a hurricane and decide...</i>

288
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:29,240
<i>'...maybe I should fly straight through it?'</i>

289
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,571
<i>"Because that's what's about to happen."</i>

290
00:24:33,777 --> 00:24:36,884
Dear Billy. You might wanna hang on.

291
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:05,132
Fox Leader to Fox Group.
Switch to inertial navigation.

292
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,211
<i>And remember the story of Icarus...</i>

293
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:11,349
<i>...whose father gave him wings made of wax...</i>

294
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:14,617
...and warned him not to fly
too close to the sun.

295
00:25:14,717 --> 00:25:19,890
<i>But the exhilaration was too great,
so he flew higher and higher...</i>

296
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,260
<i>...until the sun melted his wings...</i>

297
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,779
...and he fell into the sea.

298
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:30,399
<i>But the United States Army
is not an irresponsible father.</i>

299
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,637
<i>So they gave us wings
of white-hot, cold-rolled...</i>

300
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:37,189
...Pennsylvania steel.

301
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:41,193
<i>Guaranteed not to melt.</i>

302
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:28,567
Hey, that's pretty, huh?

303
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:36,281
Let's take them down, low and level.

304
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,324
Fox Leader to Fox Group.
Split up, survey your zones.

305
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:25,315
<i>Fox Seven, put Landsat on deck.</i>

306
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,583
<i>Copy, Fox Leader.
Fox Three headed to Zone Six.</i>

307
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:30,620
Put us down over there.

308
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,171
<i>Everyone else, stay with the team leader.</i>

309
00:27:35,223 --> 00:27:38,143
Move that gear to our three o'clock.
Let's go, let's move it!

310
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:03,601
- Ready for seismic charges.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

311
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,785
<i>Fox Group, let it fly.</i>

312
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,467
<i>Copy all, Fox Three. Heading 0-9-0.</i>

313
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,343
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

314
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:27,325
The seismic response is incredible.

315
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:39,037
Hey, Randa, you're not gonna believe this.

316
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:41,006
The bedrock...

317
00:28:41,106 --> 00:28:43,357
<i>...it's practically hollow.</i>

318
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,702
Incoming!

319
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,168
Look out!

320
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,917
<i>On guard, Fox Five!
Fox Eight is down! Fox Four is down!</i>

321
00:30:00,017 --> 00:30:01,769
Respond, Fox Three!

322
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:12,730
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- <i>Fox Seven moving into position, 3 o'clock.</i>

323
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,434
- <i>Does anybody know what that is?</i>
- <i>I don't know, man...</i>

324
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:19,437
<i>Three klicks west of Red LZ.</i>

325
00:30:19,537 --> 00:30:23,207
- <i>Jesus! I've never seen anything like it!</i>
- <i>Set a perimeter of 300 meters.</i>

326
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:25,943
<i>Roger. Climb 1,800.</i>

327
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:46,330
- Is that a monkey?
- <i>What the hell is that?</i>

328
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,367
- <i>Somebody talk to me, man.</i>
- <i>Turn right, heading 2-5-0. Contact...</i>

329
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,353
<i>Fox Leader to Fox Group. Form a perimeter.</i>

330
00:30:53,453 --> 00:30:55,005
<i>Ready gunner positions.</i>

331
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:58,976
Holy shit. Look at that thing!
I'm freaking out here!

332
00:30:59,076 --> 00:31:02,911
<i>Fox Leader to Fox Group. Fire at will!</i>

333
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:07,301
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know!

334
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:26,704
- Pull out now! Pull out!
- I don't take orders from you!

335
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:30,022
- Get us the hell out of here!
- <i>Fox Nine is down!</i>

336
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:37,931
Fox Six, we got nominal control.
We are going down.

337
00:31:42,352 --> 00:31:47,491
Fox Five, this is Fox Leader. Fox Nine
is down, one klick north of river bend.

338
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:51,610
- Insert recovery team. Over.
- Fox Five is hovering.

339
00:31:52,128 --> 00:31:54,364
We got men going out the door!

340
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,253
- <i>I need help here. I need...</i>
- Oh, shit!

341
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:11,781
- Kill this son of a bitch.
- <i>Coming in hot! I got eyes on it!</i>

342
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:13,766
Pull up!

343
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:22,975
Brace for impact!

344
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:30,583
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday!</i>

345
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,586
Run to the side, you idiot!

346
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,665
- Hang on!
- Watch out!

347
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:50,302
Oh, God!

348
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:55,024
- Prepare to crash!
- Brace!

349
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:07,269
Fox Leader is down!
Fox Five inbound for pickup!

350
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:11,590
We have him in sight! Hold tight,
Colonel Packard, we are on our way!

351
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,897
Hang on, Briggs. I'm coming.

352
00:33:31,326 --> 00:33:35,413
We're going down!
I repeat, we are going down!

353
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:39,423
Listen, I want you to tell me
something right now.

354
00:33:39,523 --> 00:33:41,303
- Do you love your mama?
- I love her!

355
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:45,622
- How much do you love your mama?
- I love my mama so much!

356
00:35:05,788 --> 00:35:11,028
Calling all units. Is anybody airborne?
I repeat, is anybody airborne?

357
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:14,463
They're all down. Every one of them.

358
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:19,267
We're on the south side of the island.
There's a river a couple of klicks from here.

359
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,438
If we stick to its banks, we'll make it
to the exfil site on the north shore.

360
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:25,809
And then what? All our choppers are down.

361
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:29,246
We'll find a way to signal the ship.
They'll send a search party.

362
00:35:29,346 --> 00:35:34,009
- We just have to make it by the exit window.
- I... I should be sitting at a desk.

363
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:36,718
So, wait, are we just not
gonna talk about this?

364
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:39,472
My best guess is we're scattered
over a four to five mile radius.

365
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:43,025
We should head north and join
anyone we find. Are you all right?

366
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,267
I don't know how to answer
that question right now.

367
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:47,217
I don't know what that was either.

368
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:50,866
All that money that they paid you?
I hope you're worth it.

369
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:54,570
We're really not gonna talk about it?
You know this is not normal, right?

370
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,154
Stuff like that doesn't just happen!

371
00:35:58,173 --> 00:36:02,206
<i>This is Fox Leader to Fox Group!
Anybody with ears, come back.</i>

372
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:05,614
- <i>Respond. Over.</i>
- Fox, Chapman.

373
00:36:05,714 --> 00:36:08,250
Fox Six, Chapman. Say again, your last.

374
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:13,354
<i>Four klicks west, highest peak,
November Alpha 3, 0, 0. Over.</i>

375
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:17,860
Roger that, Chapman.
West highest mountain peak. Over.

376
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,472
Fox Six confirm, we're at the Sea Stallion.

377
00:36:20,572 --> 00:36:24,054
Chapman, hold your position.
We'll come to you.

378
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:26,987
There's enough munitions
on that Sea Stallion to kill this thing.

379
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:31,106
Survey your perimeter.
Locate possible ambush sites. Over.

380
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:34,759
Chapman.

381
00:36:36,578 --> 00:36:39,898
Reles, taking an R and R day,
or you good to go?

382
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:42,149
I'm good to go, sir.

383
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:48,805
Chapman to all stations. Recon environment.

384
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:08,359
Cole, what's wrong with you?
How you even got an appetite right now?

385
00:37:11,113 --> 00:37:12,648
Eating's for the living.

386
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:16,180
We just got taken down by a monkey
the size of a building!

387
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,835
Yeah.

388
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:21,361
That was an unconventional encounter.

389
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:25,059
Is that really all your brain
telling itself right now?

390
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,846
There's no tactical precedence.
We did the best we could in the situation.

391
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,316
Griffin, Cole!

392
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:41,492
Thank God you guys are okay.

393
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:46,881
- Good to see you, sir.
- We're all right.

394
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:49,918
- How many left?
- Seven survivors.

395
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:54,489
Seven confirmed KIA.
Galleta, Saraf, and Hodges.

396
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,206
Slivko and the rest are unknown.

397
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:12,299
Where's Randa?

398
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,879
- How you doing?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

399
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:21,264
Good. Glad to hear it.
I was worried about you.

400
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:29,890
You are going to tell me
everything I don't know...

401
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,014
...or I'm gonna blow your head off.

402
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:36,297
Monsters exist.

403
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,280
No shit.

404
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,247
Nobody believed me.

405
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:42,585
Yesterday, I was a crackpot.

406
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:47,845
- But today...
- So this was never about geology.

407
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:50,993
You dropped those charges
to flush something out.

408
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:55,215
- Who are you?
- You heard of the USS Lawton?

409
00:38:55,315 --> 00:38:56,951
Neither did the public.

410
00:38:57,051 --> 00:39:01,322
Out of a thousand young men
on that ship, I was the only survivor.

411
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,724
They told my family she was sunk
in battle, but I know what I saw.

412
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:06,861
It had no conscience.

413
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,029
No reasoning, just destroy.

414
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:15,036
I spent the last 30 years trying to prove
the truth of what I learned that day.

415
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,477
This planet doesn't belong to us.

416
00:39:18,807 --> 00:39:23,076
Ancient species owned this earth
long before mankind.

417
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:27,214
And if we keep our heads buried
in the sand, they will take it back.

418
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:28,976
My agency is known as Monarch.

419
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:32,816
We specialize in the hunt for Massive
Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms.

420
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:35,122
You knew that thing was out here?

421
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:38,674
I'm sorry for your men, Colonel, I truly am.

422
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:42,595
Get us home, with proof.

423
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:45,067
So we can send the cavalry.

424
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,929
I am the cavalry.

425
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:03,587
It's called the Hollow Earth theory.
Randa hired me...

426
00:40:03,687 --> 00:40:08,421
...because I wrote a paper substantiating
what most people think is a crackpot idea.

427
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:13,394
That there are these massive underground
spaces isolated from the surface world.

428
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:17,096
Passageways. Randa believed
this island may be one of those.

429
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:19,899
An emergence point for whatever lives below.

430
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:22,487
Ancient species like what we just saw.

431
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,872
I thought he was out of his mind.

432
00:40:25,472 --> 00:40:28,007
This is Slivko. Do you read?
Anybody out there?

433
00:40:28,107 --> 00:40:32,562
We're headed north to the exfil location.
Everyone here seems way too calm right now.

434
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:35,916
- Do you copy? Anybody?
- We're out of range, Slivko.

435
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,049
Oh, shit.

436
00:40:37,149 --> 00:40:39,568
Save it for when we get closer to the group.

437
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:52,614
Nobody move.

438
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:56,985
Easy.

439
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:14,546
- Slivko.
- What?

440
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:20,910
Put it down.

441
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:45,522
These men did not die in vain.

442
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:47,788
I swear to God...

443
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,541
...their deaths will not go unanswered.

444
00:41:56,729 --> 00:41:59,746
Now let's get to Chapman and those munitions.

445
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:10,759
You ever heard the story of the mouse,
the lion, and the thorn?

446
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:13,816
- Yeah.
- There you go then.

447
00:42:13,946 --> 00:42:15,996
In case we ever see that primate again.

448
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:19,952
You do know that story is about a mouse
becoming friends with the lion...

449
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:23,270
...after taking the thorn
out of his paw though, right?

450
00:42:23,689 --> 00:42:27,579
No, it's not. The mouse
kills the lion with the thorn.

451
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:30,978
Who told you that, Cole?

452
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:33,548
My mother.

453
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:40,254
That actually explains a lot.

454
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:07,967
Look out! Oh, shit!

455
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:09,568
- Watch out!
- What is it?

456
00:43:09,668 --> 00:43:11,703
- Watch your six!
- Up above!

457
00:43:11,803 --> 00:43:14,420
- Up in the trees!
- Guns up!

458
00:43:20,914 --> 00:43:22,280
Cole!

459
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,182
- No, no!
- Mills!

460
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:26,166
We got you!

461
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:28,554
I can't get a shot!

462
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,743
Cut the legs! Cut it off at the legs!

463
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:07,691
I got you! Go!

464
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:34,319
Shake it off, guys! Let's move out.

465
00:44:39,456 --> 00:44:41,274
Stay tight.

466
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,115
What the hell is this?

467
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:38,549
- Behind you!
- Everybody, stay calm, stay calm.

468
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:41,919
- Conrad.
- Stay back! Stay back!

469
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:44,856
- Guys.
- Stop, stop. Stop, stop!

470
00:45:44,956 --> 00:45:47,373
Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot!

471
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:01,121
No, no, no. No need for that. Come on now.

472
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:03,690
Everybody, keep your wigs on now!

473
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:06,778
What?

474
00:46:06,878 --> 00:46:10,064
I didn't believe it
when they said you were coming.

475
00:46:10,164 --> 00:46:14,967
I was up all night just thinking about how
me and Gunpei dreamed of this moment.

476
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:18,688
And now here it is. 28 years, 11 months...

477
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:21,591
...and eight failed attempts
to get back to the world...

478
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:23,721
...and instead the world comes to me?

479
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:26,303
Ain't that a crack?

480
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:28,999
They never smile.

481
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,668
Did you crash here?

482
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:36,241
Sorry, miss.
Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.

483
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:39,077
Put the old flight suit on for you.

484
00:46:42,078 --> 00:46:44,281
You are more beautiful...

485
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:47,284
...than a hotdog and a beer...

486
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:50,270
...at Wrigley Field on opening day.

487
00:46:56,594 --> 00:46:58,411
But you're real.

488
00:47:00,632 --> 00:47:02,181
Right?

489
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:07,320
I told you. Didn't I tell you? I said...

490
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:09,689
"It's fine."

491
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:12,042
There we go.

492
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,641
There's something out there, man.

493
00:47:17,741 --> 00:47:19,784
Oh, there's a lot out there.

494
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:22,426
Now, come on. We gotta get home.

495
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:25,305
You don't wanna be out here at night.

496
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:19,595
You probably noticed a lot
of weird things on this island.

497
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:24,448
As long as we stay in here where
the people live, we'll be all right.

498
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:29,348
That wall, is that supposed
to keep out that thing?

499
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:32,891
No, he's not the one
they're trying to keep out.

500
00:50:33,743 --> 00:50:35,043
What?

501
00:50:35,143 --> 00:50:38,747
These people live up on top of the trees
while we're down on the roots.

502
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:41,331
Some of them don't even seem to age.

503
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:45,021
There's no crime, no personal property.

504
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:47,672
They're past all that.

505
00:50:59,936 --> 00:51:02,621
Thank you. Thank you.

506
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:05,673
So, good news.

507
00:51:05,773 --> 00:51:08,025
They say you can shack up here.

508
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:11,479
I didn't hear them say anything.

509
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:13,682
Oh, they don't speak too much.

510
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:17,486
When you've been here as long as I have,
you start to understand. You'll see.

511
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:20,374
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
We can't stay here.

512
00:51:20,474 --> 00:51:23,359
We have to get off the island.
We have lives. I have a life.

513
00:51:23,459 --> 00:51:26,294
Nieves, now is not the time. All right?

514
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:28,846
What lands here tends to stay here.

515
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:35,204
As far as I can tell, this ship
washed up about 10 years before I did.

516
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:37,713
- You've been here since '44?
- Yeah.

517
00:51:37,813 --> 00:51:40,108
Hey, what happened with the war? Did we win?

518
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:42,007
Which one?

519
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,128
That makes sense.

520
00:51:44,747 --> 00:51:48,997
This is all hallowed ground to them. So if
you like your hands, don't touch anything.

521
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:06,050
Look at that.

522
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:26,117
The way they tell it for thousands of years,
the people on this island lived in fear.

523
00:52:27,155 --> 00:52:29,606
That's a hell of a long time to be scared.

524
00:52:33,094 --> 00:52:36,498
And then, one day,
the damnedest thing happened.

525
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:39,312
Some of the things they were afraid of
started protecting them...

526
00:52:39,412 --> 00:52:41,819
...against the things that were eating them.

527
00:52:43,871 --> 00:52:46,089
But nothing lasts forever, I guess.

528
00:52:52,615 --> 00:52:55,867
And this is where they honor
the last of their saviors.

529
00:53:02,924 --> 00:53:04,440
Yeah.

530
00:53:05,259 --> 00:53:06,509
That's Kong.

531
00:53:10,465 --> 00:53:12,483
<i>He's king around here.</i>

532
00:53:14,803 --> 00:53:16,821
<i>He's God to these people.</i>

533
00:53:18,872 --> 00:53:20,779
Kong's a pretty good king.

534
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:23,327
Keeps to himself mostly.

535
00:53:26,114 --> 00:53:29,539
<i>This is his home. We're just guests here.</i>

536
00:53:31,384 --> 00:53:34,944
But you don't go into someone's
house and start dropping bombs...

537
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:37,138
...unless you're picking a fight.

538
00:53:37,238 --> 00:53:40,110
Wasn't Kong the one who killed your friend?

539
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:42,799
No.

540
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:45,916
One of them did.

541
00:53:46,901 --> 00:53:49,169
Kong's god on the island...

542
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:51,894
...but the devils live below us.

543
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,357
And what are they called?

544
00:53:56,644 --> 00:53:59,080
The Iwis won't speak their name.

545
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,431
But I call them skull-crawlers.

546
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,350
Why?

547
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:05,501
'Cause it sounds neat.

548
00:54:07,354 --> 00:54:09,824
- Okay.
- Look, I just made that name up.

549
00:54:09,924 --> 00:54:12,326
- I'm trying to scare you.
- I'm fine calling them that.

550
00:54:12,426 --> 00:54:15,596
- Are you cool with that? I like the name...
- Yeah, that seems like a great name.

551
00:54:15,696 --> 00:54:19,400
I've never said that name out loud before.
It sounds stupid now that I say it. Just...

552
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,983
You call them whatever you want.
They're big lizard things. Nasty.

553
00:54:25,005 --> 00:54:28,858
<i>They come from the vents deep down.
That's why Kong got so mad.</i>

554
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:33,431
<i>Those bombs woke up a bunch of them.</i>

555
00:54:37,084 --> 00:54:41,290
<i>I tell you what. You're lucky he's out there,
too, or you wouldn't have made it this far.</i>

556
00:54:41,856 --> 00:54:45,074
<i>They're crafty bastards. Mean as hell.</i>

557
00:54:49,862 --> 00:54:53,550
<i>Now, he can handle them as long as he
gets to them when they're still small.</i>

558
00:54:57,013 --> 00:54:59,826
- You don't wanna wake up the big one.
- How big is it?

559
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:02,806
It's bigger. It wiped out his whole family.

560
00:55:03,076 --> 00:55:05,611
Kong's the last of his kind,
but he's still growing.

561
00:55:05,711 --> 00:55:09,370
And you better hope he does.
Because the Iwis say once Kong goes...

562
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,680
...then the big one comes up.

563
00:55:12,953 --> 00:55:15,224
Then it's, "Goodnight, Irene."

564
00:55:16,124 --> 00:55:20,411
Listen, there's a refueling team coming to
the north end of the island in three days.

565
00:55:20,511 --> 00:55:23,863
- You should come with us.
- To the north end of the island?

566
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:27,067
- We're gonna get out of here.
- In three days?

567
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,729
Yes.

568
00:55:34,107 --> 00:55:37,925
You can't get to the north end
in three days. It's impossible.

569
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:40,096
That's it. No way.

570
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:45,401
At least not on foot.

571
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:11,394
That is one ugly ass bird.

572
00:56:28,026 --> 00:56:31,246
Dear Billy, this place is hell.

573
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:37,969
And monsters exist.
Under beds and signing paychecks.

574
00:56:38,572 --> 00:56:39,969
Come on, man. Seems like...

575
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:43,562
Like maybe he wants to go kill that ape
instead of getting us off this island? Yeah!

576
00:56:43,662 --> 00:56:45,680
- Are we even gonna make it?
- Make what?

577
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,180
The exfil! We gotta be there in three days!

578
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,537
- We'll make it. We're gonna make it.
- But, Cole, what happens if Chapman's...

579
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:54,536
Hey, the Colonel said he's there, he's there.

580
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:02,362
We were this close to getting it working.

581
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:06,030
Me and Gunpei were gonna take off
for the open sea, try to get home.

582
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,149
That's when one of them things got him.

583
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:13,021
There she is.

584
00:57:23,682 --> 00:57:25,532
Well, that's lovely.

585
00:57:27,854 --> 00:57:29,739
You're damn right.

586
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:39,699
Does this thing even float?

587
00:57:40,144 --> 00:57:43,818
Me and Gunpei spent six years
of our lives building this thing.

588
00:57:44,603 --> 00:57:46,805
She's called the Grey Fox.

589
00:57:46,905 --> 00:57:48,723
And she floats.

590
00:57:58,317 --> 00:58:01,719
Pulled the engine parts
from my P-51 and his old Zero.

591
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:04,305
Found a B-29 on the beach one day.
That was something.

592
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:08,610
You gotta be kidding me. That thing
looks like it's made out of pure tetanus.

593
00:58:10,062 --> 00:58:14,322
I know she ain't pretty to look at, but it's
nothing a couple of extra hands can't fix.

594
00:58:14,422 --> 00:58:17,484
Unless you got a better idea,
I suggest we get cracking.

595
00:58:20,005 --> 00:58:21,886
All right.

596
00:59:56,702 --> 00:59:59,370
Come on, get up!

597
01:01:05,236 --> 01:01:08,088
Well, would you look at that?

598
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,390
It bleeds.

599
01:01:12,108 --> 01:01:14,151
- Wha...
- We did that.

600
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:18,782
We hook up with Chapman, there's enough
munitions on that downed Sea Stallion...

601
01:01:18,882 --> 01:01:20,690
...to finish the job.

602
01:01:27,859 --> 01:01:29,427
Magnificent.

603
01:01:29,527 --> 01:01:32,330
You know why I carry this instead of an M-16?

604
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:36,587
Took it off a farmer fighting for the NVA.

605
01:01:36,687 --> 01:01:38,946
He surrendered right after
we leveled his village.

606
01:01:39,236 --> 01:01:42,516
He was 50 years old. Said he'd never
even seen a gun till we showed up.

607
01:01:42,806 --> 01:01:46,492
Sometimes, an enemy doesn't exist...

608
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,479
...till you go looking for one.

609
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:52,549
What happens when they
show up on your doorstep?

610
01:01:52,649 --> 01:01:54,533
I'll still have his gun.

611
01:01:55,919 --> 01:01:58,004
Best of luck with that, soldier.

612
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,451
Okay. So, we've got 48 hours
to make it to the north shore.

613
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:13,042
Slivko, do you know
what you're doing back there?

614
01:02:13,142 --> 01:02:16,205
Yeah. My pop's a mechanic.
If I can't fix this, he'll disown me.

615
01:02:16,656 --> 01:02:18,660
If he ever sees me again.

616
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,562
Hold the phone there, Churchill.
Russia was our ally.

617
01:02:22,662 --> 01:02:24,378
Now, you're saying we're at war with them?

618
01:02:24,478 --> 01:02:27,601
- It's more of a cold war.
- Cold war like...

619
01:02:27,701 --> 01:02:29,985
...like they take the summers off?

620
01:02:31,404 --> 01:02:33,841
What about the Cubs?
The Cubs win a World Series yet?

621
01:02:33,941 --> 01:02:37,512
The Cubs? Man, not even close.
Were they ever good?

622
01:02:37,612 --> 01:02:39,446
Happens to be my team. Where are you from?

623
01:02:39,546 --> 01:02:40,847
- Detroit.
- Okay.

624
01:02:40,947 --> 01:02:43,817
Yeah, the Tigers.
Did they win at all this year?

625
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:45,832
- I don't know.
- I doubt it. Yeah.

626
01:02:45,932 --> 01:02:47,588
I'd pick the Cubbies over the Tigers any day.

627
01:02:47,688 --> 01:02:50,791
Who do you think would win in a fight?
A tiger or a cub?

628
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:52,927
A tiger would win.

629
01:02:53,027 --> 01:02:55,530
Yeah, because a cub is a baby bear.

630
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:58,281
A full-grown tiger can eat a baby bear.

631
01:02:59,398 --> 01:03:01,449
Gotta think it through.

632
01:03:01,968 --> 01:03:04,288
We also put a man on the moon.

633
01:03:04,738 --> 01:03:08,189
No kidding? What did they do?
Just leave him up there?

634
01:03:08,709 --> 01:03:12,927
- What's he eating?
- Tang. Spam.

635
01:03:14,348 --> 01:03:16,912
Come on, we're losing daylight.

636
01:03:22,289 --> 01:03:24,492
<i>Fox Leader, this is Chapman, over.</i>

637
01:03:25,632 --> 01:03:28,294
<i>Fox Leader, this is Chapman, over.</i>

638
01:03:38,038 --> 01:03:39,907
Dear Billy...

639
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:42,760
"...sometimes, life just punch you
in the balls.

640
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,474
Damn it.

641
01:04:35,128 --> 01:04:37,162
What kind of music is that?

642
01:04:37,362 --> 01:04:40,233
What happened to swing? Benny Goodman?

643
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:44,753
You're like a time-traveler, man.
I'm telling you, this is the new sound.

644
01:04:51,343 --> 01:04:53,770
I don't know if I'm gonna like
whoever's under this beard.

645
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:57,310
I really hope that thing you call a boat
can get us upriver in 36 hours.

646
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:01,899
Because if we miss that window,
we're literally, up a creek.

647
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:06,058
When I first wrote that paper
on the Hollow Earth theory...

648
01:05:06,158 --> 01:05:08,443
...the whole committee laughed out loud.

649
01:05:09,095 --> 01:05:10,763
Not Randa.

650
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:14,333
The one guy in the crowd
who actually took me seriously.

651
01:05:14,433 --> 01:05:19,088
It felt good. Then I thought he was crazy
when he said the earth was full of monsters.

652
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:22,421
I can't tell when I'm talking
or when I'm not talking.

653
01:05:22,521 --> 01:05:23,751
- You're talking.
- Am I?

654
01:05:23,851 --> 01:05:25,441
- Yes.
- I'm talking?

655
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:27,413
- Yes.
- Your mouth is moving.

656
01:05:27,513 --> 01:05:28,581
What?

657
01:05:28,681 --> 01:05:31,250
I'm gonna stab you by the end of the night.

658
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,851
Really?

659
01:05:33,415 --> 01:05:35,289
Just kidding.

660
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:42,627
If the boat doesn't work,
we'll just take the train.

661
01:05:42,727 --> 01:05:47,388
Isn't it odd the most dangerous places
are always the most beautiful?

662
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:52,422
I'm trying to take a long-exposure
photograph, but my flashlight broke.

663
01:05:55,756 --> 01:05:57,376
Try this.

664
01:05:57,476 --> 01:05:59,327
Thank you.

665
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,215
- Royal Air Force?
- It was my father's.

666
01:06:03,315 --> 01:06:06,919
He threw it to me from the train
as he rolled off to fight the Nazis.

667
01:06:07,819 --> 01:06:10,155
He was like John Wayne to me.

668
01:06:10,255 --> 01:06:12,340
Some kind of mythic hero.

669
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:17,795
- Did he come back?
- His plane went down near Hamburg.

670
01:06:17,895 --> 01:06:20,147
They searched for him for months but...

671
01:06:23,903 --> 01:06:26,355
...I suppose no man comes home from war.

672
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:29,691
Not really.

673
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:41,530
Mills, quit dicking around.
I'm going on perimeter.

674
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,247
Colonel Packard...

675
01:06:55,634 --> 01:06:59,888
...this mission to the crash site is folly.

676
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:03,533
I understand going after your man.

677
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:06,460
But the rest of it...

678
01:07:07,845 --> 01:07:09,897
...this is beyond us.

679
01:07:10,915 --> 01:07:13,151
You don't like the way I'm running things?

680
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:16,003
You know where the door is.

681
01:07:17,756 --> 01:07:21,060
<i>You set this in motion
when you put this place on the map.</i>

682
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,179
<i>And I will not cut and run.</i>

683
01:07:26,648 --> 01:07:29,107
<i>I know an enemy when I see it.</i>

684
01:07:57,094 --> 01:07:59,560
This man's name was Gunpei Ikari.

685
01:08:02,733 --> 01:08:05,053
But you take away the uniforms...

686
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,354
<i>...and the war...</i>

687
01:08:08,105 --> 01:08:09,789
...he became my brother.

688
01:08:12,678 --> 01:08:15,730
And we swore we'd never
leave each other behind.

689
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:24,036
Let's get off this island.

690
01:08:33,864 --> 01:08:35,795
- Not yet!
- Prime the lines.

691
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:37,748
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:39,809
Wind it up, let's go!

693
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,814
Keep going!

694
01:08:45,877 --> 01:08:48,514
Third time's the charm.
Here we go. Here we go!

695
01:08:48,614 --> 01:08:50,931
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

696
01:08:51,031 --> 01:08:53,682
Come on, come on, come on.

697
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:56,147
Yes.

698
01:08:59,423 --> 01:09:01,892
Yes! Yes!

699
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:28,401
I guess this is goodbye.

700
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,304
Thank you.

701
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,249
If you're ever in Chicago,
look me up, I guess.

702
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:13,505
Here, no. Let me... let me help.

703
01:11:14,156 --> 01:11:16,092
Man's gotta do what...

704
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:18,462
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

705
01:11:18,562 --> 01:11:20,363
Allow me.

706
01:11:20,863 --> 01:11:22,682
You should see me in the library.

707
01:11:25,434 --> 01:11:27,204
I got a wife.

708
01:11:27,304 --> 01:11:30,156
Had a wife. Have a wife?

709
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:33,292
Guess I don't know anymore.

710
01:11:34,309 --> 01:11:36,511
We got hitched right before I deployed.

711
01:11:36,611 --> 01:11:38,982
Got a telegram from her
the day before I got shot down.

712
01:11:39,082 --> 01:11:41,184
She said we just had our baby boy.

713
01:11:41,284 --> 01:11:45,039
I got a son out there.
Grown man I've never met.

714
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:47,190
Yeah, she definitely thinks you're dead, man.

715
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:48,941
Hey!

716
01:11:49,691 --> 01:11:52,682
- I'm just saying.
- You don't know that.

717
01:11:52,782 --> 01:11:55,092
You'd be surprised how long people wait.

718
01:11:55,192 --> 01:11:57,838
Truth is, I don't expect them to be waiting.

719
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,237
I'd be fine either way.

720
01:12:01,237 --> 01:12:03,890
I just want one last chance to see them.

721
01:12:04,641 --> 01:12:06,509
That'd be good enough for me.

722
01:12:07,209 --> 01:12:09,044
We're gonna get you home.

723
01:12:09,444 --> 01:12:12,014
<i>Fox Five, come back.
Is there anyone out there?</i>

724
01:12:12,114 --> 01:12:14,284
Hey! This is Fox Five. We hear you.

725
01:12:14,384 --> 01:12:17,652
Yeah! We're on a boat.
We're on a boat headed up north on a river.

726
01:12:17,752 --> 01:12:21,668
- A boat? Where'd y'all get a boat?
- We met this, like, crazy Santa Claus...

727
01:12:21,768 --> 01:12:23,972
...time-traveler guy from World War II.
You'll meet him.

728
01:12:24,072 --> 01:12:25,274
What kind of boat y'all got?

729
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,744
It's more of, like, a plane than a boat,
really. Let's call it a "ploat."

730
01:12:28,948 --> 01:12:31,284
- We're on a ploat.
- We need their location, Slivko.

731
01:12:31,384 --> 01:12:33,824
Hey, send up a flare so we can find you.

732
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:38,394
Roger that, Fox Five. Fire in the hole!

733
01:12:43,045 --> 01:12:44,446
There!

734
01:12:44,546 --> 01:12:46,148
Yes!

735
01:12:46,248 --> 01:12:48,885
<i>I repeat, we have a visual.
Two klicks to our north.</i>

736
01:12:48,985 --> 01:12:51,823
Roger that, Fox Five. Fox One out.

737
01:12:52,722 --> 01:12:55,225
Rendezvous point, one hour.

738
01:12:55,325 --> 01:12:58,344
- Mount up!
- Can we fit everybody?

739
01:12:59,661 --> 01:13:02,811
Yes! We're going home!

740
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:10,956
Get down!

741
01:13:20,649 --> 01:13:22,551
What the hell, man?

742
01:13:22,651 --> 01:13:27,311
He's gone. Everybody, grab your gear.
We have to keep moving.

743
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:31,561
- We'll go ashore, meet up with Packard.
- No. No. Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

744
01:13:31,661 --> 01:13:33,962
Is nobody gonna say anything about the...

745
01:13:34,062 --> 01:13:37,747
He's gone! And he ain't coming back.
There's nothing to say.

746
01:13:40,802 --> 01:13:42,671
Oh, my God.

747
01:13:46,942 --> 01:13:49,227
<i>Their flare was only two klicks north.</i>

748
01:13:50,145 --> 01:13:51,781
They should be here soon.

749
01:13:52,081 --> 01:13:55,499
Unless they were eaten
by something that's bigger than us.

750
01:14:02,342 --> 01:14:04,559
- Holy shit!
- Slivko!

751
01:14:07,563 --> 01:14:09,741
- I thought you were crazy.
- I wish I had been.

752
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:12,882
- What's your count?
- What you see is what I got.

753
01:14:13,202 --> 01:14:16,204
- We lost one, too.
- Good to see you, fellas!

754
01:14:16,304 --> 01:14:19,106
- Who the hell is this?
- We picked up a hitchhiker.

755
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:22,204
Lieutenant Hank Marlow of
the 45th Pursuit Squadron of the 15th.

756
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:26,633
- You've been here since World War II?
- Yes, sir. I miss the parade?

757
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:30,351
I'll be damned. Snap to, Lieutenant.

758
01:14:30,451 --> 01:14:33,190
We're gonna get him home, sir.
If we follow this river...

759
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:35,524
...we'll make it to the boat, and we'll
make it to the north shore in time.

760
01:14:35,624 --> 01:14:37,393
That sounds good.

761
01:14:37,493 --> 01:14:41,157
But we're not leaving yet.
Still got a man out there, Conrad.

762
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:43,636
- Wait a second. You got someone out there?
- Chapman.

763
01:14:43,736 --> 01:14:45,800
He's with the downed
Sea Stallion just west of here.

764
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:49,712
West? We can't go west!
That's where the skull things live.

765
01:14:49,812 --> 01:14:53,541
We have an old saying here. "East is best,
west is worst!" That's why we say it!

766
01:14:53,641 --> 01:14:56,445
You know, southwest...
we could talk about that.

767
01:14:56,595 --> 01:14:59,614
But you're gonna need a lot
more guns if you're gonna go west.

768
01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:02,833
Guys. I think that we
should listen to Marlow.

769
01:15:03,684 --> 01:15:05,269
This is crazy.

770
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:11,014
Hey. Your job is finding lost men, right?

771
01:15:14,595 --> 01:15:15,641
Okay, sir.

772
01:15:15,741 --> 01:15:19,072
But if we reach that position and he's not
there, we don't send out a search party.

773
01:15:19,172 --> 01:15:21,202
We're back here by nightfall, understood?

774
01:15:21,302 --> 01:15:23,673
In 24 hours, we have to be
on the other side of this island.

775
01:15:23,773 --> 01:15:26,137
Roger that. Hear you loud and clear.

776
01:15:26,407 --> 01:15:29,377
All right, you heard the man.
Moving out in 10.

777
01:15:29,477 --> 01:15:33,098
This is a good group of boys.
We're all gonna die together out here.

778
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:36,300
You're a good group of boys to die with,
I'll tell you that much.

779
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,269
You shouldn't have come here.

780
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:41,549
Don't forget to tell me this is a bad idea.

781
01:15:42,089 --> 01:15:44,277
This is a bad idea.

782
01:16:19,343 --> 01:16:22,796
Yeah, you smell that? That's death.

783
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,919
What the hell is this place?

784
01:16:28,019 --> 01:16:30,342
This is what's left of Kong's parents.

785
01:16:30,442 --> 01:16:33,723
I've taken enough photos
of mass graves to recognize one.

786
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:36,290
The crash site's just
on the other side of this valley.

787
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:39,930
We'll cross through and make it
to the highest point west.

788
01:16:41,165 --> 01:16:43,168
This place is a real no-no, sir.

789
01:16:43,268 --> 01:16:45,036
We need to be going
to the north side right now.

790
01:16:45,136 --> 01:16:47,838
And you're welcome to do that, my man.

791
01:16:47,938 --> 01:16:49,673
By yourself.

792
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:51,909
I'm not leaving Jack out there.

793
01:16:52,009 --> 01:16:53,892
Now, who's with me?

794
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:56,841
- We can make it.
- You're mighty right, we can make it.

795
01:16:56,941 --> 01:16:59,767
Now, stay sharp. Keep an eye out.

796
01:17:03,555 --> 01:17:06,774
I've only been here 28 years. What do I know?

797
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:42,342
Cole, we don't got time for that, man.
Put the cigarette out.

798
01:17:55,272 --> 01:17:57,090
Watch those fumes!

799
01:17:58,242 --> 01:17:59,826
Idiots.

800
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,330
Let's go. We gotta move!

801
01:18:13,414 --> 01:18:14,963
Run!

802
01:18:18,811 --> 01:18:20,696
In here!

803
01:18:25,098 --> 01:18:26,652
Quiet.

804
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:49,694
I told you this damn place was a no-no.

805
01:18:54,746 --> 01:18:56,331
Damn it.

806
01:19:25,529 --> 01:19:28,614
All right, let's move. Rally on me.

807
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,902
Rally up! Rally up!

808
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:35,821
Somebody cover the civilians' six.
Let's move!

809
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:50,935
Oh, shit.

810
01:19:53,123 --> 01:19:54,672
Randa!

811
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,016
Set up the 50!

812
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:55,368
Go!

813
01:21:16,503 --> 01:21:18,656
Bring the torch! Do your thing!

814
01:21:43,032 --> 01:21:45,716
Slivko! Gas!

815
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,172
Marlow! Sword!

816
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,921
Slivko, hang on!

817
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,492
This thing's moving!

818
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:15,957
Now, look, Colonel.

819
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:17,992
You may outrank me...

820
01:23:18,392 --> 01:23:20,740
...but I've been here a hell of a lot longer.

821
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:26,001
And I'm telling you that thing that just
shredded us was only the first of them.

822
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:30,538
Now we're on their turf,
and we need to turn back toot sweet!

823
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:34,426
- Not as long as Chapman's still out there.
- I'm sorry, Colonel Packard.

824
01:23:35,609 --> 01:23:37,227
Chapman is dead.

825
01:23:43,301 --> 01:23:46,705
Doesn't change a thing!
We're still going to that crash site.

826
01:23:46,805 --> 01:23:48,674
What's at that crash site
that you want so badly?

827
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:51,292
Weapons! Enough to kill it.

828
01:23:51,392 --> 01:23:54,782
- Kong didn't kill Chapman.
- But he did kill these men!

829
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:58,897
- My men!
- You can't kill Kong, Colonel.

830
01:23:58,997 --> 01:24:02,194
Kong is god on this island. He's the
only thing keeping them lizard things...

831
01:24:02,294 --> 01:24:05,069
- ...in the ground.
- He's right, Colonel, we can't kill Kong.

832
01:24:05,169 --> 01:24:09,412
Now that other creature? That's the threat.
And there are more of them down there.

833
01:24:09,512 --> 01:24:11,979
If you take away
a species' natural competition...

834
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:14,715
- ...they'll proliferate out of control.
- Then we'll end them, too!

835
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:17,084
After we bring this thing down.

836
01:24:17,184 --> 01:24:20,227
- I can't let you do that, Colonel.
- Wait! Hold your fire!

837
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:25,926
This is one war we are not gonna lose.

838
01:24:26,026 --> 01:24:28,596
Nuts! You hear me? This is nuts!

839
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:32,113
- Please! You need to listen to us!
- We're not at war. You're making a mistake.

840
01:24:32,213 --> 01:24:35,380
- Your lies got my men killed!
- And you're gonna get us all killed!

841
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:39,123
- Not our fight.
- Whose side are you on, Captain?

842
01:24:39,373 --> 01:24:44,479
Okay, Colonel. You'll find your
Sea Stallion three klicks up that ridge.

843
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:49,383
Now, I'm gonna take these civilians back
to the boat, and we'll wait for you there.

844
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:51,601
All right?

845
01:25:05,899 --> 01:25:09,318
Saddle up! Let's go kill this thing!

846
01:25:14,616 --> 01:25:18,713
Steve, you running with the big dogs
or staying on the porch?

847
01:25:19,413 --> 01:25:21,021
I don't wanna be on the porch.

848
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:23,066
Marlow, you okay?

849
01:25:23,616 --> 01:25:24,867
We need to stop him.

850
01:25:24,967 --> 01:25:28,275
You wanna talk with him about it again?
He seemed to really go for it the first time.

851
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:29,959
He's losing his grip.

852
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:35,712
Now, follow me,
and we'll get off this rock alive.

853
01:25:40,499 --> 01:25:42,350
<i>Dear Billy...</i>

854
01:25:42,935 --> 01:25:45,754
<i>...I'm just trying to get home
to you and your mom.</i>

855
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,291
<i>You be strong, now.</i>

856
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:50,894
<i>Much love.</i>

857
01:25:57,517 --> 01:25:59,955
Make sure those get back to his family.

858
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:02,772
Dear Billy...

859
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:07,410
...your dad was one of the best
to ever do it.

860
01:26:14,634 --> 01:26:16,502
There's water close by.

861
01:26:16,902 --> 01:26:19,555
Are you lost? Which way?

862
01:26:20,026 --> 01:26:21,874
Hang on.

863
01:26:34,287 --> 01:26:36,223
Wait here.

864
01:26:36,323 --> 01:26:39,041
I've got to get to higher ground
to find the river.

865
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:43,097
Hey! I'm coming, too.

866
01:26:43,797 --> 01:26:45,679
I'll be right here.

867
01:26:47,834 --> 01:26:50,052
Keep your eyes open.

868
01:26:50,469 --> 01:26:52,605
Up in the trees, too.

869
01:26:52,705 --> 01:26:55,357
- Why?
- Ants.

870
01:26:55,942 --> 01:26:57,826
Big ones.

871
01:26:58,444 --> 01:27:00,328
There's one.

872
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,565
Sounds like a bird, but it's a fucking ant.

873
01:27:11,591 --> 01:27:15,595
Gather up everything you can,
including those seismic charges.

874
01:27:15,695 --> 01:27:17,913
They got his attention the first time.

875
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:35,238
- This is a bad idea.
- Let's just get on with it.

876
01:27:35,848 --> 01:27:38,918
<i>Mills, Cole, let's prep this ordinance.</i>

877
01:27:39,018 --> 01:27:41,703
<i>Make him a special gift out of that napalm.</i>

878
01:28:12,418 --> 01:28:14,774
The boat must be around that bend.

879
01:30:07,331 --> 01:30:10,183
We have to go. Now.

880
01:30:40,864 --> 01:30:42,666
Don't shoot!

881
01:30:44,469 --> 01:30:48,260
- Conrad, which way are we going?
- You three need to go back to the boat.

882
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,110
It's that way. Wait for us till dawn.

883
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:53,475
If we're not back by then...

884
01:30:53,578 --> 01:30:55,948
- ...just go.
- You ain't gotta twist my arm.

885
01:30:56,248 --> 01:30:58,499
Where are you two going?

886
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:01,568
We're going to save Kong.

887
01:31:02,252 --> 01:31:04,637
Not without me, pal.

888
01:32:44,388 --> 01:32:46,222
Oh, dear.

889
01:33:09,613 --> 01:33:13,241
Men! Place your charges.

890
01:33:13,341 --> 01:33:15,069
It's time to show Kong...

891
01:33:15,319 --> 01:33:18,171
...that man is king!

892
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:22,291
- Arm one.
- Arm two.

893
01:33:22,391 --> 01:33:24,275
Arm three.

894
01:33:25,697 --> 01:33:27,213
Packard!

895
01:33:33,104 --> 01:33:34,988
Don't do it.

896
01:33:38,674 --> 01:33:40,951
I asked you fellas nice the first time.

897
01:33:41,378 --> 01:33:44,082
- We don't wanna fight here, Packard.
- This thing brought us down!

898
01:33:44,182 --> 01:33:46,849
- It killed my men!
- Kong was just defending his territory.

899
01:33:46,949 --> 01:33:50,107
We are soldiers! We do the dirty work...

900
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:53,257
...so our families and our countrymen
don't have to be afraid!

901
01:33:53,357 --> 01:33:57,159
They shouldn't even know
a thing like this exists!

902
01:33:57,259 --> 01:33:59,311
You've lost your mind.

903
01:34:01,214 --> 01:34:03,056
Put that detonator down.

904
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,264
Stop!

905
01:34:21,717 --> 01:34:23,785
The world is bigger than this.

906
01:34:24,455 --> 01:34:28,698
Bitch, please! Slivko, get her out of there!

907
01:34:30,793 --> 01:34:33,439
You know it's the wrong thing to do, son.

908
01:34:50,512 --> 01:34:54,165
- Put it down, sir.
- Packard!

909
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:08,964
Come on.

910
01:35:09,064 --> 01:35:10,899
It's over.

911
01:35:26,247 --> 01:35:29,468
- That's the big one.
- Fall back.

912
01:35:32,355 --> 01:35:33,859
Go!

913
01:35:43,332 --> 01:35:44,916
Colonel.

914
01:35:45,868 --> 01:35:47,451
Sir!

915
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:10,440
Die, you mother...

916
01:36:27,417 --> 01:36:29,319
Kong's down. Let's go!

917
01:36:34,783 --> 01:36:36,603
- They told us to leave at dawn.
- I know.

918
01:36:36,703 --> 01:36:38,152
- It's dawn.
- I know!

919
01:36:38,252 --> 01:36:40,522
So what are we going to do?

920
01:36:53,535 --> 01:36:55,804
This is the edge of the island.

921
01:36:55,904 --> 01:36:59,208
Weaver, get up on those rocks
and fire a flare.

922
01:36:59,308 --> 01:37:00,950
With any luck, Brooks will see it.

923
01:37:03,979 --> 01:37:05,796
We'll buy you time.

924
01:37:07,613 --> 01:37:08,868
This way.

925
01:37:23,132 --> 01:37:25,951
Come on. Every second counts.

926
01:37:33,058 --> 01:37:36,792
Cole! Come on, man, we gotta fall back.

927
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:39,848
Go live your life. Get out of here.

928
01:37:42,718 --> 01:37:43,760
- Cole!
- Cole, no!

929
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:45,711
- Cole, no!
- Stop!

930
01:37:45,811 --> 01:37:48,090
Cole! Cole!

931
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:50,392
No! Don't!

932
01:37:50,492 --> 01:37:52,061
Cole!

933
01:37:52,861 --> 01:37:54,363
Cole!

934
01:38:00,102 --> 01:38:03,767
Come on. Come on. Son of a bitch.

935
01:38:29,101 --> 01:38:31,515
Come on! Go!

936
01:40:18,206 --> 01:40:20,489
Come on! Go!

937
01:40:22,376 --> 01:40:24,594
Come on! Hurry!

938
01:40:30,912 --> 01:40:32,785
Come on!

939
01:40:39,094 --> 01:40:42,579
- Marlow, a little help here!
- She's temperamental. Watch out!

940
01:41:31,779 --> 01:41:34,381
- Clear!
- Clear!

941
01:41:35,782 --> 01:41:37,834
Come on, you bastard!

942
01:42:27,968 --> 01:42:29,352
Weaver!

943
01:44:17,610 --> 01:44:21,613
Weaver? Weaver. Weaver. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

944
01:44:25,085 --> 01:44:26,898
You're okay.

945
01:45:17,535 --> 01:45:19,337
So what do you think, fellas?

946
01:45:19,537 --> 01:45:21,389
This way to Key West?

947
01:45:22,275 --> 01:45:24,126
I think it is, brother.

948
01:45:25,243 --> 01:45:27,194
This place will change.

949
01:45:27,678 --> 01:45:29,529
Word will get out.

950
01:45:30,015 --> 01:45:31,783
It always does.

951
01:45:31,883 --> 01:45:34,102
Well, it's not coming from us.

952
01:45:38,589 --> 01:45:42,477
<i>We'll meet again</i>

953
01:45:43,462 --> 01:45:45,731
<i>Don't know where</i>

954
01:45:45,831 --> 01:45:48,813
<i>Don't know when</i>

955
01:45:48,913 --> 01:45:52,371
<i>But I know we'll meet again</i>

956
01:48:21,241 --> 01:48:24,053
<i>...here we go now
to the Cub half of number eight.</i>

957
01:48:24,153 --> 01:48:28,780
<i>If you want to see a crowd go crazy, see
what happens if this guy hits one right now.</i>

958
01:48:29,927 --> 01:48:31,986
<i>Fly ball, very deep.</i>

959
01:48:35,565 --> 01:48:40,020
<i>And the impossible dream
just became the possible dream!</i>

960
01:56:42,949 --> 01:56:45,033
<i>You just gonna sit there?</i>

961
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,905
<i>In the dark.</i>

962
01:56:49,489 --> 01:56:51,491
<i>You're enjoying this, right?</i>

963
01:56:52,493 --> 01:56:54,575
Is this fun for you?

964
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:58,064
- I promise I won't tell the Russians.
- I promise I will tell the Russians.

965
01:56:58,164 --> 01:57:00,216
She's gonna tell the Russians.

966
01:57:07,374 --> 01:57:09,477
- Why are you keeping us here?
- I wanna go home.

967
01:57:09,577 --> 01:57:14,013
We get it. There was no island.
We were never on an island.

968
01:57:14,113 --> 01:57:16,313
Island? What island?

969
01:57:16,413 --> 01:57:19,940
- Brooks, what the hell is going on?
- Welcome to Monarch.

970
01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:25,222
This island is just the beginning.

971
01:57:25,322 --> 01:57:28,159
- There's more out there.
- What do you mean, "more"?

972
01:57:28,259 --> 01:57:31,608
This world never belonged to us.
It belonged to them.

973
01:57:31,708 --> 01:57:34,861
The question is how long
before they take it back.

974
01:57:36,432 --> 01:57:39,638
Kong... is not the only king.
