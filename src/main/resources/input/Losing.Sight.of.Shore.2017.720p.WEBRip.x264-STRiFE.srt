1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,648
[Natalia whispering]
<i>Can you hear the silence?</i>

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,256
[in normal voice]
<i>If something was to happen,</i>

3
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,460
<i>I know that I've had no regrets</i>
<i>in my life whatsoever.</i>

4
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,596
[Lizanne] <i>Life is fragile,</i>

5
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:33,767
<i>and there's a real sense</i>
<i>of helplessness.</i>

6
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,673
[Emma] <i>I've not got anything left to give.</i>

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,043
[Laura] <i>I just...</i>

8
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,445
<i>really want to get home.</i>

9
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,330
[man 1] <i>The vast Pacific Ocean</i>
<i>is a formidable force.</i>

10
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,664
<i>In the history of humans,</i>

11
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,267
<i>only very few have been able to cross it.</i>

12
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,503
[woman 1] <i>The man and his partner</i>
<i>were pulled from heavy seas 11 days ago.</i>

13
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,707
[woman 2] <i>Six-meter swell</i>
<i>struck the rowers' boat, rolling it.</i>

14
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,409
[man 2] <i>Two women rowers spent 16 hours</i>

15
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>clinging to the hull of their boat</i>
<i>in the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

16
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,481
[woman 3]
<i>This was their second failed attempt.</i>

17
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,588
[man 3] <i>Now a dramatic rescue at sea.</i>
<i>A giant wave caught them by surprise,</i>

18
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,890
<i>instantly flipping the boat over.</i>

19
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,259
[woman 4] <i>She had to cling on for her life</i>

20
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,563
<i>as the boat capsized</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

21
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,233
[woman 5] <i>The whole trip very nearly ended</i>
<i>in tragedy.</i>

22
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,311
[woman 1] <i>Now, to the story of four women</i>
<i>who are about to embark</i>

23
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,646
<i>on an incredible challenge.</i>

24
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,715
[man 1] <i>The first all-woman crew</i>
<i>to row more than 8000 miles</i>

25
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,450
<i>across the world's largest ocean.</i>

26
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,920
[woman 2] <i>An amazing journey rowing</i>
<i>across the Pacific Ocean.</i>

27
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,624
[man 2] <i>From California in the U.S.</i>
<i>to Cairns in Australia...</i>

28
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,293
[man 3]<i> Two will row</i>
<i>as two sleep below deck,</i>

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,664
<i>two hours on, two hours off,</i>
<i>24 hours a day.</i>

30
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,832
<i>There will be no support boat</i>
<i>in the Pacific.</i>

31
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,301
<i>They reckon it will take</i>
<i>six and a half months.</i>

32
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,204
[woman 3] <i>So, why would four women</i>
<i>take on this dangerous task,</i>

33
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,708
<i>arguably the hardest ocean crossing</i>
<i>in the world?</i>

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,428
Laura?

35
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:15,929
[Laura] Thank you!

36
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,232
<i>My name's Laura Penhaul,</i>
<i>and I'm part of the Coxless Crew.</i>

37
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,836
It's really bizarre to be here 'cause this
is three and a half years in the making.

38
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,309
<i>We're doing a team selection.</i>
<i>Trying to select the right crew</i>

39
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,344
and looking at different personalities.

40
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,748
<i>We are focusing a lot at the moment</i>
<i>on our physical training,</i>

41
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,852
<i>but I would say 80 percent of it</i>
<i>is going to be our mental strength.</i>

42
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,588
It's a massive expedition.
It's one thing thinking it.

43
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,724
It's whether you actually go through
with it.

44
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,959
<i>It's been a long road to the start line.</i>

45
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,630
<i>In October 2012, we chose</i>
<i>to represent Breast Cancer Care</i>

46
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,267
<i>and I decided to use all of my savings</i>
<i>to begin construction on </i>Doris.

47
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,970
<i>A year and a half into the project,</i>

48
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,306
<i>Cambridge rower Emma Mitchell</i>
<i>joined the team.</i>

49
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,642
<i>There was a lot of hard work</i>
<i>securing sponsorships that we needed.</i>

50
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,413
<i>We did a final recruitment in May of 2014,</i>

51
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,682
<i>and this is where we met Izzy, Natalia,</i>

52
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,718
<i>as well as our two reserve rowers,</i>
<i>Lizanne and Meg.</i>

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,490
<i>We've trained extensively,</i>
<i>both mentally and physically,</i>

54
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,559
<i>to make sure we are best prepared</i>
<i>for anything that we face.</i>

55
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,695
<i>At the end of the day,</i>
<i>this is unsupported.</i>

56
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,964
<i>We've got to roll with the punches.</i>
<i>That's part of the expedition.</i>

57
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,666
To me, if you've then got
somebody following you along,

58
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,468
it's too easy to have an option

59
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,271
to jump out and go,
"We'll just jump on that bigger ship

60
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,340
because that's going to be
a bit more comfortable,"

61
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,376
rather than riding out the storm
and doing what we've set out to do.

62
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,449
<i>When people have second-guessed it</i>
<i>or not believed in it,</i>

63
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,918
<i>it's only driven me more</i>
<i>to want to make it happen.</i>

64
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,920
She didn't want to look back
in ten years' time

65
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,588
and say "I wish I'd done that."

66
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,024
<i>She just said, "We're gonna do it."</i>

67
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,961
I need to fit everything
in that cabin first.

68
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,496
Then we can go.

69
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,633
I think at the moment, being
on the oars in <i>Doris</i> is my happy place.

70
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,536
I'll see if that's still the case
by the time we get to Australia.

71
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,873
[Sara] <i>When Emma got involved in rowing,</i>
<i>she must have been 12, 13 years old.</i>

72
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,309
She stopped everything for rowing.

73
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:13,313
It was fairly phenomenal
what an impact rowing had on her.

74
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,952
<i>It was like this focus, this drive,</i>
<i>that gave her strength and character.</i>

75
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:19,886
And she loved it.

76
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,721
<i>I mean, she was out</i>
<i>at 5:00 in the morning.</i>

77
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,691
<i>She would be blue with the cold</i>
<i>when she'd come back.</i>

78
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:33,033
It could be a midlife crisis, but it would
be an impressive midlife crisis to have.

79
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,635
"What did you do?"
"Well, I rowed across the Pacific."

80
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,703
So, here we are.

81
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,540
We're going to see Natalia
getting her ECG done.

82
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,409
Hey, Nat!

83
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,712
<i>She's lived an amazing life of 15 years</i>

84
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,048
<i>of going from place to place</i>
<i>and only doing the things</i>

85
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,083
<i>that she truly loves and adores.</i>

86
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,619
<i>It's crazy.</i>
<i>I've never known and I'm sure</i>

87
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,654
<i>I will never meet anybody like it again.</i>

88
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,991
I'm not going to say I want her
to be married and have children,

89
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,459
because I really don't care.

90
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,561
<i>If that's not her life,</i>
<i>that's not her life.</i>

91
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,397
<i>She must just be fulfilled</i>
<i>in whatever she does.</i>

92
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,033
[Natalia] <i>All of my past experiences</i>

93
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,402
have actually been so instrumental

94
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,937
<i>into getting me here.</i>

95
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,541
It just feels really strange.

96
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,978
And it feels slightly
like just a training row, as well.

97
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,012
But...

98
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,114
I'm sure it will be real soon enough.

99
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:26,052
[Jean] <i>Isabel has climbed</i>
<i>to over-6000-meter peaks in the Himalayas,</i>

100
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,389
<i>and when she heard about this,</i>
<i>she saw it</i>

101
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,626
as a really serious challenge
and she wanted to pursue it.

102
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,833
[Isabel] <i>I like to not stick out,</i>
<i>and I like to take the ordinary course.</i>

103
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,068
It's quite hard to actually stop
and say, "You know what?

104
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,471
I think I want to do something
massively different."

105
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,707
<i>The main reason</i>

106
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,843
<i>is to test myself</i>

107
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,012
and just to see what I'm capable of.

108
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,080
[speaking indistinctly]

109
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:03,957
So, if you can imagine the wind is coming
from that direction, from over there.

110
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:04,891
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

111
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,628
You would put the para anchor in
on that corner. Yeah.

112
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,430
[Emma] <i>Tony is our shore support.</i>

113
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,032
<i>He will be in touch with us</i>

114
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,501
on a daily basis
whilst we're out in the ocean.

115
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,437
[Tony] Make sure
it's really done up tight.

116
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,006
<i>I hear the girls are going</i>
<i>to break lots of records.</i>

117
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,841
The girls aren't going
to break any records.

118
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,978
They're going to establish records
because this has never been done before.

119
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:28,782
<i>The fact that it hasn't been done before</i>
<i>is testament to how tough it is.</i>

120
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,486
[Emma] <i>We're rowing</i>
<i>from San Francisco to Hawaii.</i>

121
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,622
<i>Have a few days to restock the boat.</i>

122
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,558
<i>And then we row</i>
<i>between Hawaii and Samoa.</i>

123
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:44,064
<i>And then the final leg is from Samoa</i>
<i>over to Cairns in Australia.</i>

124
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,867
<i>The whole journey in total is 8446 miles.</i>

125
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,973
[Laura] <i>What I loved about this route</i>
<i>in particular</i>

126
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,808
<i>is there's never been a male team either.</i>

127
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:59,145
This is the first fours boat ever to cross
the Pacific Ocean, north or south.

128
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,686
[Jean]<i> I've had moments that I found it</i>

129
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,789
absolutely devastating,
the idea that she's doing it.

130
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,091
Aw...

131
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,929
[Sara] <i>I'm her Mom.</i>
<i>She's still my little girl.</i>

132
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,565
She's about to go out
onto that huge ocean,

133
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,867
<i>and a bit of me is terrified.</i>

134
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,972
Quite a strange sense of calm.

135
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,942
Let's hope it's not the calm
before the storm.

136
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,845
See you later!

137
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,514
Adieu!

138
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,951
Mwah. Love you!

139
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,954
We're about to row the Pacific!

140
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,222
[all laughing]

141
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,795
[Emma] This is so surreal. [laughs]

142
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,597
[Laura] So surreal.

143
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,198
Three cheers for <i>Doris!</i>

144
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,134
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-[all] Hooray!

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,603
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-Hooray!

146
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,104
Hip, hip, hooray!

147
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,324
[Natalia] <i>So, this is it.</i>

148
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,827
<i>The journey has begun.</i>

149
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,930
This is really happening.

150
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,619
<i>We're starting to get our routines</i>
<i>a little bit slicker,</i>

151
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,690
<i>getting on and off the oars,</i>
<i>which is good.</i>

152
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,692
<i>This is going to be</i>
<i>a period of adjustment.</i>

153
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,998
Ah, hello. We just got off the oars,

154
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:03,136
and about an hour ago
we saw a whale in the distance.

155
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,305
Oh, my God!

156
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,173
Jesus, he's huge!

157
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,375
[Emma] <i>Neither of us had ever seen</i>
<i>a whale before.</i>

158
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,846
He just poked his blowhole out.

159
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,815
Whoa!

160
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,953
One came and
fully breached out of the water.

161
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,254
[all shout]

162
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,390
[Natalia] <i>I was fairly petrified,</i>
<i>to be honest.</i>

163
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,259
Petrified-stroke-fascinated.

164
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,896
<i>It was the strangest feeling</i>
<i>I've ever had.</i>

165
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,800
I'd love to capture that feeling
and put it in a bottle.

166
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,069
<i>I've never felt so alive.</i>

167
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,238
Oh, my God!

168
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,108
There's not many things
where I feel adrenaline like that.

169
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,977
<i>Day one.</i>

170
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,080
Hundred and fifty-four days to go.

171
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,839
-It's 1:30 in the morning.
-It is indeed.

172
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:18,945
And we've just done our, um,
first fully dark night shift.

173
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,448
So, we're going to snooze until 3:00?

174
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,783
-Yep.
-And then...

175
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,252
And then we're back on the oars
at quarter past 3.

176
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:32,191
[Emma] <i>Life on </i>Doris
<i>is beautifully simple.</i>

177
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,929
<i>All you have to do is sit on the oars</i>
<i>and row for two hours,</i>

178
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,398
<i>and then you have your two hours</i>
<i>where you're either eating</i>

179
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,099
<i>or sleeping or doing the jobs</i>

180
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,101
<i>and stuff that you need</i>
<i>to do on the boat.</i>

181
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:48,107
[Laura] Doris<i> is our pink 29-foot</i>
<i>ocean rowing boat.</i>

182
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,443
<i>There's two cabins, one at each end.</i>

183
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,280
<i>The cabins are about the size</i>
<i>of a fairly small two-man tent.</i>

184
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,349
<i>We've got solar panels</i>
<i>along the top of the boat,</i>

185
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,051
<i>and they're connected to our batteries,</i>

186
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,754
<i>which are underneath the bit</i>
<i>that we sleep on in the cabin.</i>

187
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,725
If we drain those batteries,
we've got no way of using our GPS

188
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:09,028
<i>or making water</i>
<i>and stuff off the electrics.</i>

189
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,998
<i>So, we need to be really careful</i>
<i>and calculated about that.</i>

190
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,333
<i>I tell you what.</i>

191
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,836
Spend 48 hours sitting
in your own bathtub at home

192
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,138
<i>and imagine you've got a lid over it,</i>

193
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,974
<i>so, you can't quite sit up straight.</i>

194
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,444
<i>That's pretty much what it's like</i>
<i>in the forecabin.</i>

195
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,747
[Isabel] <i>It is breakfast time.</i>

196
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,749
Emma is going to tell you
what we have today.

197
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,417
On today's menu,

198
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:35,488
for Miss Isabel Burnham
we have some beef shepherd's pie.

199
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,324
This is our cooker.

200
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,794
Our little jet boil,
so, we have to boil up some water.

201
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,964
We should probably run
the water maker, as well, Ems.

202
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:45,932
Yeah.

203
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,402
We've got enough food to give each of us
about 5000 calories every day.

204
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,839
And the bulk of those calories
come from our expedition foods,

205
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,941
<i>which are freeze-dried ration packs.</i>

206
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,545
There we go, then we just leave it
for a little while to rehydrate,

207
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,147
and then... hot food.

208
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,515
Thanks, Ems!

209
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,272
Night shifts are the worst

210
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,840
<i>because you just wake up,</i>

211
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,878
<i>you've got to get back into your cold,</i>
<i>wet, soggy wet-weather gear,</i>

212
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,915
<i>wet socks, wet shoes, and you've gotta</i>
<i>get out of the warm sleeping bag</i>

213
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,384
<i>and then not fall asleep</i>
<i>if you're some of us.</i>

214
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,290
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

215
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:48,428
is the ritual that happens
every two hours, without fail.

216
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,607
[Emma] <i>This is a week we've been at sea.</i>

217
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,509
It's a beautiful sunny day,

218
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,112
and it would be really lovely
except for that fact

219
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,616
that there is a lot of wind
and a lot of very big waves,

220
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,251
which are quite scary.

221
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,221
<i>Every time you go on the oars,</i>
<i>you get completely soaked.</i>

222
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:22,228
Little bit of a frustrating day today,
to be honest.

223
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:27,200
<i>The wind is pushing us back</i>
<i>towards the coastline.</i>

224
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,436
<i>And the wind is due</i>
<i>to pick up again this evening.</i>

225
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,939
[Laura] <i>The size of these waves</i>

226
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,942
are slightly scaring me a little bit.
They're pretty massive!

227
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,878
<i>Today they seem to have gotten</i>
<i>a hell of a lot bigger.</i>

228
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,348
One minute you're looking up
at a three-, four-story house,

229
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,584
and then the next minute
you're on top of the Pacific.

230
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,585
<i>They're huge.</i>

231
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,957
<i>The wind's just too strong.</i>

232
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,060
It's about 25 to 28 knots.

233
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:59,365
<i>We basically have to sit tight here</i>
<i>for the next pretty much 48 hours.</i>

234
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,367
We want to be out there rowing

235
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,170
and we want to be rowing
in the right direction.

236
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,410
[speaking indistinctly]

237
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:12,645
[Emma] <i>Tad bit of a drama.</i>

238
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,415
We went to go and check on the batteries.

239
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:20,052
I pulled the cushions back,
and the whole hatch was full of water.

240
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,989
We lost the MPPT box, which is basically

241
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,426
<i>the bit of equipment that connects</i>
<i>the solar panels and the batteries.</i>

242
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,262
Thing is, we're now coming into nighttime.

243
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:33,299
At the moment, we're not emitting
any signal, which is a bit of a concern,

244
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,034
whether boats...

245
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,136
Well, they won't see us, basically.

246
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,605
<i>So, we've checked the other hatches,</i>
<i>and actually,</i>

247
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,108
<i>there's a load of water</i>
<i>in a load of other hatches.</i>

248
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,246
[Natalia]<i> Our decision was made</i>
<i>for us, really.</i>

249
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,982
<i>We're going to have to go back to land.</i>

250
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,453
Very depressing.

251
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,656
Very frustrating. Um...

252
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,624
But there's nothing
we can do about it.

253
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,061
<i>Right now we're actually heading</i>
<i>for Santa Barbara.</i>

254
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,067
Yeah.

255
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,436
It's not a great start to an ocean row,
that's for sure.

256
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,539
Anyhoo...

257
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,391
[Laura] <i>Being out here</i>
<i>has made me question why...</i>

258
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,594
Why are we out here?
Why are we doing this?

259
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,764
Why did I persevere for four years to make
sure this project got off the ground?

260
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,032
And not...

261
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,335
Not just because I know
that I'm bloody stubborn.

262
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,740
<i>The story of why we're here</i>
<i>and why we're doing it for breast cancer.</i>

263
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:52,278
Patricia was the most beautiful woman,
and she was in the perfect place.

264
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,748
<i>Patricia was the person</i>
<i>that would walk into a room</i>

265
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,018
<i>and everybody would be drawn to her.</i>
<i>She's just lovely.</i>

266
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,655
<i>It was actually her husband, Rashid,</i>
<i>that I know very well.</i>

267
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:06,058
<i>They had just been on their honeymoon</i>
<i>and she fell pregnant.</i>

268
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,761
<i>And they were just in that perfect bubble.</i>

269
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,432
<i>And then, unfortunately,</i>
<i>two months into her pregnancy,</i>

270
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,334
she found a lump.

271
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,106
<i>He was hugely premature,</i>
<i>but he survived it, little Yassin.</i>

272
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,474
<i>He's gorgeous.</i>

273
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,412
<i>She just drew on this strength</i>

274
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:30,082
<i>and resilience that Rashid talks about</i>
<i>which is just unbelievable.</i>

275
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,751
[Patricia] Do we have to?

276
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,653
[babbles]

277
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,588
Yeah, we've got to.

278
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,557
And we've got to.

279
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,559
[Laura] <i>I saw her within that period,</i>

280
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,361
and she was experiencing a lot
of neck pain and back pain,

281
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,564
<i>so, we sent her back to her oncologist,</i>

282
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,466
<i>and that's when they found</i>
<i>that she had secondaries.</i>

283
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,235
[Rashid] Give Mama a kissy.

284
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,603
Give Mama a kissy. Come on.

285
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,779
I took each day for granted,
and don't do that.

286
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,080
Just get on with life.

287
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,615
[Rashid] What happens
if things get difficult?

288
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,618
You just keep going
and you keep going and you keep going.

289
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,324
[Laura] <i>It was within about two months</i>
<i>after that that she passed away.</i>

290
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,471
<i>I guess out here it makes you realize</i>
<i>all of those sorts of things.</i>

291
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,406
<i>Simple things like love</i>

292
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,675
<i>and having friends</i>
<i>and family around you</i>

293
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,110
<i>that are just amazing.</i>

294
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:32,678
<i>I guess the point is</i>

295
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,448
life's too short
and you really do have to live it.

296
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,651
Um... We really, really believe in that,

297
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,520
and that's why we're here and that's
why we're doing what we're doing.

298
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,658
<i>Patricia wouldn't have given up at all.</i>

299
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,495
<i>She was fighting for her life, so,</i>
<i>we can fight to get across to Australia.</i>

300
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,845
Seamanship is about making
the right decisions at the right times,

301
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,413
<i>and that's what they've done.</i>

302
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,917
You want to undo
that bowline for us, Nat?

303
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,861
<i>They are now actually</i>

304
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,564
further away from Honolulu than they were
when they started out in San Francisco.

305
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,800
<i>Also, they've come further south now,</i>

306
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,871
<i>so, they've lost the advantage of going</i>
<i>west from a more northerly position.</i>

307
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,939
<i>So, in all honesty, it's likely</i>

308
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,442
to be a longer row starting out
from Santa Barbara

309
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,278
than it was starting out
from San Francisco.

310
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,347
[speaking indistinctly]

311
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,550
[Natalia] <i>What we've just done</i>
<i>was a perfect insight</i>

312
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,286
<i>into the hardships that are going to come.</i>

313
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,654
<i>It's going to be a long journey,</i>

314
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,257
but it's going to be an amazing one.

315
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,764
[all laughing]

316
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,220
[Emma] Nat looks very happy
to be back outside on the oars.

317
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,355
Try as we might,

318
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,292
we are still only just about going west.

319
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,327
But it is better than southeast.

320
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,605
<i>We haven't seen the sunshine,</i>
<i>the stars or the moon for about a week.</i>

321
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,774
We're hoping that at some point soon

322
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,310
the weather starts
to get a little bit better.

323
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,318
[Laura] <i>We've got both wind</i>
<i>and current now against us.</i>

324
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,687
This is fine.
It's just part of the challenges.

325
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,690
[groans]

326
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,772
[Laura] <i>We just ticked off 300 miles!</i>

327
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,840
So, like totally nearly there.

328
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,309
Only like 2000 to go and that's Hawaii.

329
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,410
[both chuckling]

330
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,979
We'll be there in a couple of days!

331
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,280
Oh, dear.

332
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,291
[Laura] <i>It's Emma's birthday today.</i>
<i>She's 30!</i>

333
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,327
And it's actually been a blue-sky day,
which is great.

334
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,664
So, um, we've just set up some balloons.

335
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,499
[laughing]

336
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,334
[all] ♪ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♪

337
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,905
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♪

338
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,675
Emma's amazing. She is very different

339
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:53,979
to anyone that I would ordinarily
be friends with

340
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,782
<i>because she's very quiet</i>

341
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,684
<i>and very introverted</i>

342
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,954
<i>and isn't incredibly emotional</i>
<i>or expressive.</i>

343
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,024
<i>She's just really steady,</i>

344
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:09,428
and I think I'm gonna value that hugely
on the boat.

345
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,600
You can tell with Emma
she just loves rowing.

346
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,903
<i>She's just so happy as soon</i>
<i>as she gets onto the oars.</i>

347
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,973
[Emma]<i> It's one of those sports</i>
<i>that when you start it</i>

348
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,444
you kind of get hooked because it's more
than just the actual exercise bit.

349
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,348
It's such a community
and such a team activity.

350
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,851
[Laura] Here's a little something
from all of us.

351
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,789
It's a little oar with a little message
on the back.

352
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:42,061
[Laura] <i>Ems leaves her heart and soul</i>
<i>on those oars every time.</i>

353
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,398
She's gonna be one of the rocks
in the boat that keeps us all together.

354
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,409
[Emma] <i>Good morning!</i>

355
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,877
<i>We're now heading on a bearing</i>

356
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,413
to Hawaii again, which is quite exciting,

357
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,782
and hopefully,
we'll pick up a bit of speed.

358
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,087
We're making progress,
very slowly, but making progress

359
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,622
because we are moving west.

360
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,658
<i>And we've slipped into this pattern,</i>
<i>really.</i>

361
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:17,429
<i>To be honest, for me</i>
<i>it's become quite a monotonous pattern.</i>

362
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,466
<i>The shifts move very, very quickly,</i>

363
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,967
<i>on the oars, off the oars.</i>

364
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:26,005
<i>Daytime into nighttime,</i>
<i>nighttime into daytime.</i>

365
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,541
<i>Rowing, resting, rowing, resting.</i>

366
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:36,081
[Laura]<i> I think the overall effect</i>
<i>of living life</i>

367
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,952
<i>in two-hourly chunks is that</i>
<i>you're so focused on each two hours</i>

368
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,954
<i>that you just don't notice</i>
<i>where the time's gone.</i>

369
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,589
[Natalia] <i>The biggest surprise for me</i>

370
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:49,061
<i>is actually how quickly we adapt</i>
<i>as human beings, physically and mentally,</i>

371
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,730
<i>to a situation</i>
<i>that we've put ourselves in.</i>

372
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,742
My main concern right now

373
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,046
is that we have a weather window
when we look at the full picture

374
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,514
for getting to Cairns.

375
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,948
<i>The longer we take on this leg,</i>

376
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,584
<i>the less time we have</i>
<i>to do the other legs,</i>

377
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,086
<i>and it has a knock-on effect.</i>

378
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,808
[both shout]

379
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:36,809
It's chilly!

380
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,650
[woman laughs]

381
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,027
[Natalia whispering]
<i>Can you hear the silence?</i>

382
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,898
It's ridiculous.
You never just hear nothing out here.

383
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,701
We're in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,

384
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,536
and there's not a sound.

385
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,608
Missing home a bit today. Just thinking...

386
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,878
that we missed out on quite a lot,

387
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,280
um, while we've been out here.

388
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,281
But, um...

389
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,218
then again, you're sort of... out here

390
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,755
on a night like this
or an afternoon like today in the sunshine

391
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,924
and think that you'd rather be doing this
than anything else.

392
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,968
I have big concerns
about the amount of stress

393
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,936
that I'll be putting my family under.

394
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:42,040
<i>I think they felt it was</i>
<i>an unnecessary risk to take</i>

395
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,010
because they didn't understand
the motivation.

396
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,613
If you don't understand
why someone would want to do it,

397
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,884
then of course it seems
like an unnecessary and crazy thing to do.

398
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,854
[Jean] <i>I have very,</i>
<i>very supportive friends,</i>

399
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,191
<i>but they have no comprehension</i>
<i>of how difficult it is,</i>

400
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,193
because their children have not decided

401
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,829
that they're going to do something
quite so extreme.

402
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,699
[Tony] <i>When you asked me</i>
<i>would I ever row an ocean,</i>

403
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,203
the reason I say no is because
I know how tough it is to row an ocean

404
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,806
and I know how much
you've got to want to do it.

405
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,576
[Isabel] <i>When I started,</i>
<i>I knew it would be a big project,</i>

406
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:20,612
but I didn't realize how, how big.

407
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,715
<i>Before we left San Francisco,</i>

408
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,685
<i>I made the difficult decision</i>
<i>to only row one leg.</i>

409
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,756
<i>As much as I desperately wanted</i>
<i>to row the whole way,</i>

410
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:31,857
<i>the only thing</i>

411
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:36,161
that's more important than what
I really want to do is my family.

412
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,159
Very lovely.

413
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,727
Let's resume.

414
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,203
Rowing. We don't do enough of this.

415
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,373
We only do 12 hours of this every day.

416
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,009
We've only done 1200 miles so far.

417
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,143
Yeah, not a lot.

418
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:30,249
<i>Within the first three minutes</i>
<i>speaking to Laura,</i>

419
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:34,152
I just knew
that we had a very similar value system.

420
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,824
[Laura] <i>I've always wanted</i>
<i>to sort of have an impact</i>

421
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:42,294
and make sure that in my life
I've kind of achieved things

422
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,862
that have made a difference.

423
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,700
<i>I've always loved doing sport.</i>

424
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,903
As a kid I would either be doing
cross-country running

425
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,671
<i>and playing hockey or netball.</i>

426
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,275
<i>Even at the age of 12,</i>
<i>I knew I wanted to be a physio.</i>

427
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,810
<i>And now I'm 32, I am a physio.</i>

428
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,880
<i>But I think when I was about 8,</i>
<i>I would watch the Olympics</i>

429
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,215
<i>and said to my mom and dad:</i>

430
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:06,218
<i>"You know, one day I'd love</i>
<i>to be at the Olympics,"</i>

431
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,320
<i>not realizing in what capacity.</i>

432
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,690
<i>Now I've been to two Paralympics</i>

433
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,792
<i>and we've got Rio when I finish the row.</i>

434
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,328
My work is part of my identity.

435
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,963
It's what I live for.

436
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,401
<i>To me, being involved in Rio</i>
<i>is kind of the pinnacle of my career.</i>

437
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:26,405
<i>But I think sometimes you've really</i>
<i>got to go with your gut, when you know...</i>

438
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,841
There's certain opportunities that come up
you just know you have to take.

439
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,411
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her.

440
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,781
<i>I think we'd follow her</i>
<i>wherever she wanted to take us, really.</i>

441
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,062
[man over radio] <i>Yes, </i>Doris,<i> go ahead.</i>

442
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,299
Yeah, we can see you
approaching us at the moment.

443
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:59,504
If you can keep a bit of a safe distance.
We have pretty much no maneuverability.

444

<i>don't worry about that.</i>

446
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,946
Yeah, we're on, uh, day 57
since we left Santa Barbara.

447
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,184
-[man] <i>That's a long slog.</i>
-[laughs]

449
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,455
<i>You're gonna get bounced around.</i>

450
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,290
<i>You'll feel it.</i>

451
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,525

<i>Tropical Storm Ella.</i>

454
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,905
Lots of waves coming over.

455
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,841
<i>Uh, heavy wind.</i>

456
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:41,913
The wind has picked up again, and we
were getting blown really far south.

457
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,218
There's big swells. Um...

458
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,254
We're on the edge of a tropical rainstorm,
and there's a lot going on.

459
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,126
Really windy out there.

460
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,363
We're fighting against the wind
and the current as well at the moment.

461
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,509
Feel a little bit like you're getting hit
by a bus, to be honest.

462
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,357
<i>The only thing I could think about</i>
<i>for the whole session was:</i>

463
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,992
<i>"You've gotta row, you've gotta row."</i>

464
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,862
<i>I was almost having to convince myself</i>
<i>every single stroke to just not stop.</i>

465
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:40,038
[Natalia] We're rowing
like we've never rowed before.

Look, Nat!

467
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,295

About one mile to go.

Less, 0.2 miles to the entrance.

<i>Coming back to land</i>
<i>and eating fresh, hydrated food</i>

was absolutely incredible.

<i>I think as well as the taste sensation,</i>

485
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:53,472
<i>it's also the colors, the array of colors</i>
<i>that you get in real food</i>

486

that you just don't get
in dehydrated food.

00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,212
This whole meal is heaven.

488
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,381
[Lizanne] This is the one plus
about rowing an ocean:

489
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,719
you can eat brownies for days.

490
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:14,059
<i>My name is Lizanne van Vurren,</i>
<i>and I was born in South Africa.</i>

491
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,294
I wasn't the typical, I guess,

492
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,597
girl who played inside with dolls all day.

493
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,465
<i>I was a bit of a tomboy.</i>

494
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,537
<i>I messaged Laura and I said,</i>
<i>"What you're doing is amazing."</i>

495
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:29,241
So, she messaged me back and said,
"Well, why you don't join me?"

496
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,776
<i>"I don't row. I don't live in England.</i>

497
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,246
<i>You must be joking." And she said:</i>

498
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,014
"None of that matters."

499
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,683
<i>So, I was held as a reserve</i>

500
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,019
<i>and then Laura called me and said:</i>

501
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:42,787
"Can you still do it?"

502
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,390
And I was like, "Okay!"

503
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,525
And that was it.

504
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,563
<i>I'll be rowing to Samoa,</i>

505
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:57,602
<i>and then Megan Dyos will take over</i>
<i>from me and go to Cairns.</i>

506
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,540
It's just something so far
from what I've ever done before

507
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,241
or even thought possible.

508
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,612
[Laura]<i> Girls,</i>
<i>thanks for making this happen.</i>

509
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,816
For finally being an amazing team.
I'm so proud of all of you.

510
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,718
And of Meg, who's not here.

511
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,221
But cheers,
and thanks for the first leg, Izzy.

512
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,490
We've adored you,
and we're going to miss you massively.

513
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,392
[all] Cheers!

514
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,694
Cheers, ladies.

515
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:36,274
I don't think I realized how
such different reasons

516
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,410
would bring four people
to do the same thing.

517
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,346
<i>My part of the journey has come to an end.</i>

518
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,682
<i>I couldn't have asked</i>
<i>for any more from my experience.</i>

519
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,146
[Tony]<i> California to Hawaii was in theory</i>
<i>going to be the easy leg.</i>

520
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,115
<i>Leg two is a tough one, really.</i>

521
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,452
Leaving from here,
they've got to row more or less due south.

522
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,688
[Laura] <i>It's supposed to take</i>
<i>about 60 days, but just who knows?</i>

523
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,124
<i>The problem is, this year, is El Niño,</i>

524
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,760
<i>and we hadn't factored in actually</i>
<i>how much of an effect that's had</i>

525
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:31,563
on the trade winds
just 'cause there isn't any trade winds,

526
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,132
so, there's no assistance,
and a lot of ocean rowing

527
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,468
is about assistance with the wind.

528
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,637
I mean, God!

529
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,806
Yeah, it's all getting real now.

530
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:18,376
<i>It feels like I'm in a completely</i>
<i>different world. I can't explain it.</i>

531
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,380
It's just like we've been taken
from our day-to-day life

532
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,616
and just inserted in the ocean,

533
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,818
<i>and all you have to do is row.</i>

534
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,524
Oh, my God.

535
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,732
[Laura]<i> Lizanne and I</i>
<i>just stuck our heads in</i>

536
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:44,402
to, um, see the fishies
up close and personal.

537
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,339
Here she comes.
She's got the old fishing hook.

538
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:53,745
-So...
-Has it got an instruction manual?

539
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:54,946
[chuckles]

540
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,451
I'm not really one for an instruction
manual anyway, so, that's all right.

541
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:03,488
But maybe if we find it in the book
and it's edible, we can...

542
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,624
We can cut it open and eat it.

543
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,260
[laughing]

544
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,662
-Would you?
-Yeah, too right.

545
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,297
-Okay.
-Give it a go.

546
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,865
Not... Yeah.

547
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,501
Maybe. [chuckles]

548
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,271
<i>I really connect with Lizanne.</i>
<i>She's just a breath of fresh air.</i>

549
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:25,677
[Natalia] <i>It's just been a really</i>
<i>different energy to have on the boat,</i>

550
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,379
<i>which I think for the three of us</i>
<i>doing the full journey</i>

551
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,647
<i>is really important.</i>

552
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:33,718
Whoo!

553
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,894
[Natalia] <i>It's Saturday, which means...</i>

554
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,797
[both] it's Lipstick Saturday!

555
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,434
[chuckles]

556
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,770
We just had a really, really lovely shift.

557
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,571
<i>We saw a beautiful little turtle!</i>

558
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:54,973
[Lizanne] <i>Yeah, on its own.</i>

559
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,509
<i>Just bobbing along next to us.</i>

560
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,745
<i>There's something about being out here</i>

561
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:05,416
and there's no noise,
like just nothing apart from us.

562
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,417
It's amazing.

563
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,888
Don't even have, like, an engine
to ruin that for us.

564
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,326
Is it me or does it feel
like we're standing still?

565
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,998
<i>I now realize why people love rowing.</i>

566
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,433
<i>It is so soothing.</i>

567
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,054
[thunder rumbling]

568
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,575
[Emma] <i>So, we have just got off the oars</i>
<i>after two hours</i>

569
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:08,012
in crazy wind and waves and, um, rain,

570
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,647
which was pretty unpleasant,

571
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:14,118
and we haven't really made
very much progress during that two hours.

572
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,987
In the time it took us to swap over,

573
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:20,491
we've drifted north again,
so, we need to go south.

574
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,362
Okay, I'll get up in a couple of hours
and do the log book.

575
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:27,899
We're drawing a pretty beautiful picture.
We're now going east.

576
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,067
[Laura] Yeah, I figured.

577
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,836
[Emma] Just radio us if you need anything.

578
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,040
-Night, guys!
-[woman] Good night.

579
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,888
[Tony] <i>They've gotta cross over through</i>
<i>the Intertropical Convergence Zone,</i>

580
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,056
which is the doldrums,
as the sailors used to call it.

581
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,895
<i>There's a current which is running</i>
<i>in the opposite direction,</i>

582
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,864
<i>so, it's running east, so,</i>
<i>a little bit like a riptide on a beach.</i>

583
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,800
<i>They can't try and fight into it.</i>
<i>They need to get across it.</i>

584
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,771
[Emma] <i>We seem to have entered</i>
<i>the equatorial countercurrent,</i>

585
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,073
which is pushing us east very fast,

586
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,143
and then we've got a southerly wind,
which is pushing us north,

587
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:16,414
meaning that for quite a lot of the night
we've been going northeast,

588
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:19,784
um, and Samoa, from here, is southwest.

589
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,958
There's a lot of thunder activity,
so, it's gonna be hot and humid.

590
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:31,195
<i>Large area to cross where the current</i>
<i>will take them in the wrong direction.</i>

591
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,204
[Laura] What's going on, LV?

592
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,607
[Lizanne] I'm feeling really nauseous.

593
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,781
So, I just stay like this for a while
and then it goes away.

594
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,787
We're very much
in the thick of the whole doldrums stuff

595
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,790
going on at the moment,
so, some really weird weather.

596
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:10,101
So much torrential rain and squalls

597
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,804
<i>and dramatic skies,</i>

598
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,806
<i>pan-flat oceans,</i>

599
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,943
<i>incredible light reflected on the water.</i>

600
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,113
<i>Just an ocean</i>
<i>that I've never known before.</i>

601
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,783
[thunder rumbling]

602
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,119
[Lizanne] <i>It's day 34,</i>

603
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,522
and I'm still being seasick.

604
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,725
I'm sick of being sick.

605
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:38,129
I can't really keep food down.
My energy levels are low.

606
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:48,639
<i>There's never a time on the boat</i>
<i>where you miss a shift.</i>

607
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:53,811
<i>There's never a time where</i>
<i>you ask someone to sub in for you.</i>

608
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,948
<i>You carry on two hours on, two hours off.</i>

609
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,985
<i>I was sick over the side.</i>

610
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,921
<i>I'd get back up and I'd carry on rowing.</i>

611
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,798
[Natalia] <i>It's just a little bit painful</i>

612
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,899
at the moment.

613
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,002
Occasionally we'll pick up speed
and it'll be great,

614
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:21,172
but it won't last longer
than a couple of shifts.

615
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,313
[Emma]<i> We've really struggled</i>
<i>with adverse currents,</i>

616
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,050
adverse winds.
We don't seem to have a lot of help

617
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,619
going on at all from Mother Nature.

618
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,687
<i>This leg has been a fight.</i>

619
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:41,059
<i>I feel like we've been fighting the ocean,</i>
<i>fighting the currents, fighting the winds,</i>

620
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,162
fighting the little gremlins
in my head that are telling me

621
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,130
that we're never gonna get there.

622
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,702
[Lizanne] <i>We thought we'd be</i>
<i>at the equator well over two weeks ago.</i>

623
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:56,607
It's us against the currents, and we can't
row any harder than we are already.

624
00:42:56,674 --> 00:43:00,344
Our hands are aching and just trying to...

625
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,713
Trying to row as hard as we can.

626
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,115
I think we're all...

627
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,283
[sniffs]

628
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:08,252
getting a little bit low.

629
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:19,130
[Natalia] <i>It's, um, day 42.</i>

630
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,034
We are still stuck
in the doldrums, literally.

631
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:25,970
We're just having a look
at the chartplotter.

632
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:28,272
We've got about, um...

633
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:33,911
239 nautical miles to go
until we hit the equator.

634
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,714
At the current speed
at which we're traveling,

635
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:40,718
it will take us another 20 days
just to get to the equator.

636
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,620
Um...

637
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,222
How do you feel about that, LP?

638
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,223
Great.

639
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,893
[both laugh]

640
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,318
[whale bellows]

641
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,126
[Natalia] <i>I'm so excited to see Samoa.</i>

642
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:25,730
-I've been waiting for this for a year.
-You have.

643
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,432
This is why you joined the row,
to come to Samoa.

644
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,967
Pretty much, to see Samoa.

645
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,270
I thought,
"What a great way to get to Samoa."

646
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,705
You've seen a lot of sights in your time.

647
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:42,914
[Natalia] <i>I look out into that ocean,</i>
<i>and my thoughts just stop.</i>

648
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,318
<i>I don't know if that's because</i>
<i>I'm so used to spending time traveling</i>

649
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:49,253
<i>and being on my own.</i>

650
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,158
It's definitely the furthest outside
of my comfort zone I will ever have been,

651
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:58,396
uh, in respect to the fact
that I've never rowed before.

652
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:03,301
<i>If I believed it was</i>
<i>a predominantly physical challenge,</i>

653
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,468
<i>I wouldn't have applied.</i>

654
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:07,405
<i>This challenge is 90 percent mental.</i>

655
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:12,076
<i>And I always believe that you do</i>
<i>your most developing and growth</i>

656
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:14,245
<i>when you're outside your comfort zone.</i>

657
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,916
When you put your mind to something,
anything is truly possible.

658
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:19,984
And...

659
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:22,420
I'm learning that.

660
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,393
<i>Just had this overwhelming feeling</i>
<i>come over me,</i>

661
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,863
where I just decided
that I just didn't want to row anymore.

662
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,034
<i>I just got so bored of the motion</i>
<i>of going forwards and backwards,</i>

663
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,271
<i>forwards and backwards,</i>
<i>and forwards and backwards,</i>

664
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:42,239
<i>so, I screamed out into the air.</i>

665
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,508
[screaming]

666
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,221
The reason that I'm doing this row is
to test the strength of my human spirit.

667
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,889
And to find...

668
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,159
where that place is deep inside,

669
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:06,364
where you have to dig deep
when things get tough.

670
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:14,505
Things are just taking us a lot longer
than we anticipated.

671
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,308
But it's these kind of moments,

672
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,111
an amazing sky,

673
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,380
four friends on a boat,

674
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,783
and that makes it all all right!
[chuckles]

675
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,986
[Laura] <i>Very poignant moment.</i>

676
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,021
[Natalia] <i>Why's that?</i>

677
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,556
'Cause we're near the equator!

678
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,458
-Woo-hoo!
-Boop, boop!

679
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,395
We've been waiting
for this moment for, uh...

680
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:41,298
-Ever!
-Fifty-four days, I do believe.

681
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:43,434
We're here.
That's all that flipping matters.

682
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,869
[Natalia] Yeah. Exactly.

683
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,971
[all] Three...

684
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:48,172
[Natalia] Very slow countdown.

685
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,140
[all] Two...

686
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,308
One.

687
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,977
[all] Whoo!

688
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,378
[Laura] The equator!

689
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,981
We're at the equator!

690
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:58,182
Whoo!

691
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,586
We'd like to make a toast to Neptune.

692
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,058
Thank you for getting us
to the equator safely.

693
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:12,430
And your ocean has become
very special to all of us, so...

694
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:14,298
cheers!

695
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:19,270
Ooh! [speaks in Spanish]

696
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,074
And, please, will you make us
go quicker from here on.

697
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,542
[all laugh]

698
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:34,985
High five!

699
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,120
High five!

700
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,549
[Emma] <i>When we crossed the equator,</i>

701
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,984
<i>Tony sent us a message</i>

702
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,520
<i>and he was like, "Congratulations,</i>
<i>you're the first team of four</i>

703
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,489
<i>who has ever rowed across the equator."</i>

704
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,325
<i>We are self-supporting ourselves,</i>
<i>and we're this tiny little boat</i>

705
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,628
<i>in this massive ocean,</i>
<i>and that's pretty special.</i>

706
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:23,534
[both cheering]

707
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:43,087
After struggling with currents

708
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:45,055
and wind

709
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,358
and doldrums,

710
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,361
we are now into the heat phase.

711
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:55,966
It is ridiculously hot outside,
and we're just dripping with sweat.

712
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,270
It's almost, like, unbearably hot.

713
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,539
Like, you can hardly breathe, it's so hot.

714
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,376
We're back in the cabin, and it's 99--

715
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,311
Nine-point-nine degrees Fahrenheit

716
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:10,447
and it feels cool,
which is never a good sign.

717
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,992
[sighs]

718
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,130
Just come in
from a two-hour rowing session.

719
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:32,536
Possibly the hottest, uh,
I've ever been in my life.

720
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:34,572
<i>Fairly unbearable,</i>

721
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,508
<i>just not knowing what to do with yourself.</i>

722
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,992
[computer panel beeps]

723
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:04,568
[Emma] <i>Today we got an e-mail from Tony</i>
<i>talking about our timeline.</i>

724
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:07,471
<i>So, it's looking like it's going</i>
<i>to take us at least another 30 days,</i>

725
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:11,141
<i>which kind of makes us another month</i>
<i>behind schedule.</i>

726
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,013
<i>We had our little kind of chat</i>
<i>about it all together,</i>

727
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,381
<i>and Laura was saying:</i>

728
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:20,684
"We can't assume everyone
is okay with that

729
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,387
and everyone is going to want
to get back in the boat in Samoa."

730
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,791
-We're gonna be rowing at Christmas.
-Yeah, we are.

731
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,727
Christmas on <i>Doris!</i>

732
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:31,462
No.

733
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,098
LP can't be rowing
on Christmas on <i>Doris.</i>

734
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,332
I know.

735
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,508
[Laura] <i>It's actually my work.</i>

736
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,579
Part of why I'm here
is because of what I do with Paralympics

737
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:52,583
and working with the Paralympic team
and British athletics.

738
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:54,618
Um...

739
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:56,820
And...

740
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,292
you know,
this year is not a great year for me

741
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:05,562
to have been out doing this row.
It was already a problem I postponed it.

742
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,432
More of a problem myself.
My work are brilliant.

743
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:10,701
They've been extremely supportive.

744
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,805
Which is why it's even harder because
I just don't want to let the team down.

745
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,675
But the problem is
I don't want to let that team down,

746
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:22,413
and I don't want to let this team down.
I feel like I'm a little bit torn.

747
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:27,217
<i>And everything out here</i>
<i>is taking so much bloody longer</i>

748
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,386
<i>and it's so unpredictable</i>

749
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,323
that I have no idea when
we're gonna finish this damn thing.

750
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,827
<i>The hardest thing is having to choose</i>
<i>between the row or work.</i>

751
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,864
Not finishing this row
and not being in Australia kills me.

752
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,168
<i>So, it's basically...</i>

753
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,772
<i>my immediate family of four</i>
<i>that are on this boat</i>

754
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,374
<i>compared to...</i>

755
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,677
the whole British Athletics team,
I don't know.

756
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,725
I don't know if I want to be rowing
on Christmas on <i>Doris.</i>

757
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,728
I don't want to be rowing
on Christmas on <i>Doris.</i>

758
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:13,430
But I don't want to not row
all the way to Australia.

759
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,498
No, I know.

760
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,866
[Lizanne] <i>Before we set off on the row...</i>

761
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:53,537
<i>Keith, our psychologist,</i>
<i>got each of us doing a family plan.</i>

762
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:57,174
<i>It was really difficult to do</i>
<i>because you have to write</i>

763
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:59,943
<i>a step-by-step plan</i>
<i>of how do you want to find out</i>

764
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,212
<i>if something happens to your family.</i>

765
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,748
It was one of my fears
before I got on the boat

766
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:08,318
that something might happen
to a family member

767
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:09,686
or someone that I love,

768
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,655
and that's happened.

769
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,724
[crying]

770
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,494
<i>I received some news that,</i>

771
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,764
unfortunately, my uncle
has lost his fight with cancer,

772
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,868
and I didn't expect that to happen
while I was on the boat.

773
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,639
<i>He was a remarkable man,</i>

774
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:32,376
<i>and it breaks my heart</i>
<i>that I can't be there with them right now.</i>

775
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:34,812
And there's...

776
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:38,382
a real sense of helplessness.

777
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,558
I'm so sorry that I'm not there.

778
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,297
<i>All I really wanted to do was just go</i>
<i>for a walk and clear my head,</i>

779
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,631
<i>and you can't.</i>

780
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,367
<i>You're on that boat</i>
<i>and you can't get away.</i>

781
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:03,707
But what it has done
is it has really driven home to me

782
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,242
why I'm out here

783
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:06,944
and why we're doing what we're doing.

784
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,847
<i>We're helping someone fight a fight.</i>

785
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:12,549
<i>It's given me a push,</i>

786
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,252
<i>and it's made me work</i>
<i>that little bit harder</i>

787
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,254
<i>to reach our destination.</i>

788
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:20,591
Life is fragile.

789
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:25,262
That's why we're doing crazy things
like row an ocean,

790
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,498
because you only have one life,

791
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,400
so, you might as well
make the most of it.

792
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,743
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>I can't believe I'm not there.</i>

793
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:12,609
We're a little bit worried
that we're gonna miss Samoa.

794
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,350
<i>Yeah, don't want to miss Samoa,</i>
<i>because the next stop would be Fiji,</i>

795
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,952
<i>and that's another 500 miles.</i>

796
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,954
[Natalia] <i>Yeah, 5-, 600 miles.</i>

797
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,690
There's a very strong westerly current

798
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:28,825
and there's very strong winds
of 15 to 18 knots

799
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,594
that are southeasterly.

800
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:35,699
<i>At this precise moment,</i>
<i>we're in fear of missing Samoa.</i>

801
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:43,340
Been struggling with just doing
the same thing every day

802
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:46,577
<i>and going so slowly.</i>
<i>It feels a bit endless at the moment.</i>

803
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:48,812
[woman over phone]<i> What's going on?</i>

804
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,747
We're just getting caught
in the currents still.

805
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:54,051
We're going completely west now, as well.
It's a nightmare.

806
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,722
We're doing what we can.
We can only control the controllable.

807
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,869
Leg two has been really difficult...

808
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:15,806
um, for the majority of us on the boat.

809
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,774
The monotony, the boredom.

810
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:20,477
You know, Lizanne,
bless her, losing her uncle.

811
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,479
I've had issues
with obviously the length of time

812
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,882
we're now out here for
has impacted on my work.

813
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,819
<i>But one person in particular is Emma...</i>

814
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,522
<i>who's for a few weeks now</i>
<i>has been in a really, really...</i>

815
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,926
<i>difficult sort of place</i>
<i>and hasn't been sharing it.</i>

816
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,629
<i>But you knew that something was wrong.</i>

817
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:39,896
<i>She's my teammate.</i>

818
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,165
<i>I want to make her happy,</i>
<i>I want to see her smile,</i>

819
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,634
<i>I want to hear her laugh,</i>

820
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:46,903
and she's not doing any of those things,

821
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,905
and I don't know what I can do to help.

822
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:01,084
[Emma] <i>I'm so tired right now.</i>

823
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:04,521
We've just been rowing so hard
every single shift

824
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,557
and I've not got anything...

825
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:08,859
Um...

826
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:10,627
Anything left to give.

827
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:14,197
Like, physically and mentally,
I'm just completely exhausted.

828
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,034
And, um...

829
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:21,204
I don't know how long we've still got
to go to Samoa. We keep...

830
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,441
going a bit faster
and we think we're going to get there

831
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:26,576
and then we slow down
and start going the wrong way.

832
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:30,614
Being out on the oars
has always been where...

833
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:33,617
I've been really happy and where...

834
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:34,751
Um...

835
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,587
[sighs]

836
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,824
<i>I've started to really hate it.</i>

837
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:44,461
<i>I've started to really hate every time</i>
<i>I have to get out on the oars and row.</i>

838
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:48,732
<i>I've been really struggling.</i>
<i>I haven't been able to control the boat.</i>

839
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,568
<i>It doesn't seem to matter what I do,</i>
<i>it doesn't make any difference.</i>

840
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:56,707
Rowing has been part of my life
for such a long time,

841
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,575
like a really important part.

842
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,883
<i>If someone told me I never had</i>
<i>to row again, I would be really happy,</i>

843
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,786
and that makes me really sad because...

844
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,895
<i>we've still a long way to go,</i>
<i>another leg to get to Cairns,</i>

845
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,598
<i>and I don't know if I can...</i>

846
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:23,900
<i>Yeah.</i>

847
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:05,208
[Tony] <i>Just getting the latest position.</i>
<i>I believe we are about two miles away</i>

848
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,811
<i>but I just want to double-check</i>
<i>the little dot</i>

849
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,313
we're seeing on the horizon
is actually them.

850
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,885
There they are,
right in the horizon there!

851
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,745
[Laura] <i>We have been battling</i>
<i>the currents, the winds.</i>

852
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,181
We were extremely concerned at points

853
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,883
that we may have to overshoot Samoa,

854
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,187
which was devastating to us
that that might have been the case.

855
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,790
And I think the thought of that
made us dig even deeper

856
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:55,158
than we thought we could do,

857
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:59,663
and we powered as hard as we could,
and we were absolutely--

858
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,899
I think we left everything on the boat,
everything on the ocean, just to get here,

859
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:03,934
and I'm so glad we did,

860
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,838
because this would have been a devastation
to have missed this.

861
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:11,241
We are very proud to be here
and to share this with you.

862
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,719
[crowd cheering]

863
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:30,193
For Emma,
this journey was a really big challenge

864
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,930
because she wanted to be able
to control the boat.

865
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:39,769
<i>And one person cannot control</i>
<i>a one-ton boat.</i>

866
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,339
You know, it's physically impossible.

867
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,179
[Tony] <i>When you gear yourself up</i>
<i>for being at sea for 60 days</i>

868
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:51,214
and you're out there for over 90,

869
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,250
it's got to affect how you feel,
hasn't it?

870
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,222
[Lizanne]<i> When rowing wasn't fun</i>
<i>for her anymore...</i>

871
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,726
it was really hard to watch because...

872
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:06,363
it wouldn't make her happy,
it would make her frustrated.

873
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,399
<i>I hope that she finds her happy place.</i>

874
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:17,707
What she's really needed to do
is actually step back and take stock

875
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:21,811
of not only what she's doing
but who she is as a person, really,

876
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:27,217
because I think, you know, when
the essence of who you are is questioned,

877
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,921
<i>then where do you go from there?</i>

878
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:37,928
[Laura] <i>Getting to the finish and knowing</i>

879
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:40,697
<i>that you've achieved</i>
<i>what you've set out to achieve...</i>

880
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:42,232
<i>You know, it's four years of hard work.</i>

881
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,235
I mean, to walk away from it
any sooner than that,

882
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,137
I would just be devastated.

883
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:50,006
So, to me, Australia is home
and nothing ever before that.

884
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:52,042
[both shout]

885
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:07,390
[Natalia] That is like a big blooming...

886
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,793
-[Lizanne] Rhino horn.
-...rhino horn.

887
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:18,802
I can't believe I'm leaving.
I can't believe this day has come.

888
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:22,172
I've built a really special bond
with each of you.

889
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,175
Best of luck for your last leg.

890
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,245
You've got an amazing new asset
to the team.

891
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,013
Meg, good luck.

892
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:37,887
<i>The value of a team is so much more</i>
<i>than I've ever imagined.</i>

893
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:41,191
And we will forever be the girls
who rowed together.

894
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:58,441
[Meg] <i>My name is Meg Dyos, and I'm 25.</i>

895
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:01,244
No one tells you when you finish uni
it's not very exciting.

896
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:03,246
It's like, what do you want to do
with your life?

897
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,981
It's always, you have to have an answer.

898
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:08,118
When you don't have an answer,
it's like, "Oh, oh, dear."

899
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:11,187
And that's where it's like,
"Is there something wrong with me

900
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,290
that I don't know what I want to do
with my life?"

<i>I've never been in the ocean.</i>

903
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,865
In all honesty, I have absolutely
no idea why they chose me.

904
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,000
I mean, I couldn't be happier
that they chose me,

905
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:26,202
and I really hope there is something
they've seen in me

906
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,338
that can help us get to Australia.

907
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:29,439

01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:05,341
[Meg] <i>Waking up every two hours</i>
<i>at night, literally it feels like</i>

977
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:09,379
you've been hit by a sledgehammer
and you just--

978
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,748
<i>You don't have any choice.</i>
<i>That's the whole thing about this.</i>

979
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,183
<i>It doesn't matter how bad you're feeling.</i>

980
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,519
<i>You don't have a choice.</i>
<i>You have to get back on the oars</i>

981
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,254
<i>and you have to row.</i>

982
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,457
[wind roaring]

983
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:31,167
[Natalia] <i>We've just come in from I'd say</i>
<i>one of the most hectic shifts so far.</i>

984
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:35,238
Big, massive, massive waves.

985
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:38,875
I don't think I've had a less fun shift
on <i>Doris</i> so far.

986
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,577
These three girls.

987
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:45,448
It makes me a bit emotional
when I even think about them

988
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,250
<i>and just... how far they've gone.</i>

989
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,219
<i>And I feel like in each of them,</i>
<i>I've seen...</i>

990
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,755
<i>I've seen some sort of pain.</i>

991
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:55,692
<i>And you can just tell</i>
<i>that they've been at sea for a long time.</i>

992
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,936
[Emma] <i>We've been living in this</i>
<i>for eight months.</i>

993
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:11,474
It's become all that we've known, really.

994
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:14,711
-This is just life.
-It's such a strange existence.

995
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:17,980
Eight months is such a long time
to do something.

996
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,485
I wonder what we'll be like
when we get back to land.

997
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:27,256
I wonder how quickly
we'll adapt to sort of so much noise

998
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:30,460
-and pollution and people.
-People.

999
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:33,529
[Emma]<i> Life will be so complicated</i>
<i>after this.</i>

1000
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,867
[Natalia] <i>There's definitely</i>
<i>a big part of me that wants to hold on</i>

1001
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:39,936
<i>and wants to stay out here</i>

1002
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:44,540
<i>because of the utter beauty</i>
<i>of where we are.</i>

1003
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,843
<i>There's just nothing like it.</i>

1004
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:48,945
<i>The only way I can describe it</i>

1005
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:53,816
for me is that it's been ultimate freedom
out here.

1006
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:56,819
Just freedom from...

1007
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,622
societal norms,

1008
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:02,992
freedom from expectation,

1009
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,660
<i>from the ego...</i>

1010
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,597
<i>It's just been an incredible opportunity</i>

1011
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:11,701
to delve so deeply within your soul.

1012
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:20,576
[Emma] <i>So, yeah, it's crazy.</i>
<i>I can't believe it's nearly Christmas.</i>

1013
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,678
And when we left the U.K.,

1014
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:25,681
it was the very beginning of April.
It's absolutely mental.

1015
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,416
I can't believe we're still out here.

1016
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:31,020
<i>And I don't know how we're still doing</i>
<i>what we're doing every day, every shift,</i>

1017
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,722
<i>but we are.</i>

1018
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:33,856
[bell rings]

1019
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,461
[Laura] <i>Friends and family and stuff</i>

1020
01:11:38,528 --> 01:11:41,330
are all at home
celebrating Christmas and, um,

1021
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:45,802
yeah, I just don't feel very Christmasy
even though we've got decorations up

1022
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,638
and we're listening
to Christmas carols and stuff and...

1023
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,975
Um, yeah, I just found it quite difficult,
really, being away.

1024
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,378
<i>Didn't realize how difficult I'd find it.</i>

1025
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:58,514
Hi, Auntie Mary. How are you?
Happy Christmas!

1026
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,696
Mom, the signal's not very good.
I can't hear you very well.

1027
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:17,767
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1028
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,371
The signal isn't very good.
I can't hear you.

1029
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:30,112
Jesus Christ... Ugh.

1030
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,916
-[Meg] Do you want to plug it in?
-Oh, don't even get me started.

1031
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:42,792
[Meg] <i>At home at the moment...</i>

1032
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,627
Oh, yeah, it's Christmas Day at home.

1033
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:48,531
It's about 3 p.m.,
which for me is the time when, uh...

1034
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,633
It's main-course time. Main course.

1035
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,935
It's roast-potatoes time, let's face it.

1036
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:55,004
-It's roast potatoes and gravy.
-Yeah.

1037
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:57,006
Um, being out here's way better.

1038
01:12:57,073 --> 01:13:00,042
We've got our socks on.
I'm in a wet bed sheet.

1039
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,878
Soggy sheet. [laughs]

1040
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:16,125
Ho, ho, ho,
and welcome to Christmas on<i> Doris.</i>

1041
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,637

Happy New Year!

[Laura] <i>Good morning, world, it is...</i>

1052
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:29,999
<i>the 1st of January.</i>

1053
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:35,705
This is definitely one of the best ways
to bring in a new year.

1054
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:39,041
In the middle of this beautiful,
wonderful, huge,

1055
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:41,644
enormous, expansive ocean.

1056
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:53,656
It is day 55, and in my prediction,
we have 15 days to go.

1057
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:55,658
In yours we have 25.

1058
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:56,859
Let's hope you're right.

1059
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:58,794
The food is 13.

1060
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,644
Four hundred and ninety-eight miles to go.

1061
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:20,783
[Emma]<i> We had such a good start</i>
<i>to this leg,</i>

1062
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,752
and everyone got really overexcited.

1063
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:26,756
Our parents booked their flights
to Australia to come meet us,

1064
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:29,525
and then
it's all gone kind of horribly wrong.

1065
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:32,895
This precise moment,
I'm completely over it.

1066
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:36,265
<i>My hip and back have really flared up.</i>

1067
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:50,713
Over 215 days now at sea in total,
not including our stop-offs...

1068
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:55,251
having rowed over 7000 flipping miles...

1069
01:15:56,652 --> 01:16:00,890
and been out here for nearly nine months,
it's starting to take its toll just a bit.

1070
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,961
I'm so looking forward to getting to
that finish line, you would not believe.

1071
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:12,601
<i>Ugh. I just really want to get home.</i>

1072
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,659
[Natalia] <i>The last few days have been</i>

1073
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:41,964
<i>a little bit of a struggle.</i>
<i>Not only are we in a confined space,</i>

1074
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:43,732
<i>we're sleep-deprived.</i>

1075
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:46,001
<i>We're quite often in physical pain.</i>

1076
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:48,871
<i>They're cumulative,</i>
<i>and they start to take their toll.</i>

1077
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:52,074
-[Laura] What's going on, Megs?
-I'm tired.

1078
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,144
I'm really tired and I can't stay awake.

1079
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:58,747
And I feel like I can't get
the tiredness away,

1080
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:01,884
because there's no time in the day
to catch up on sleep.

1081
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,694
[Emma]<i> We're gonna run out</i>
<i>of meals soon.</i>

1082
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:15,131
Which means we've gotta do 50 miles
from tomorrow onwards.

1083
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:17,933
Okay, we might.

1084
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,036
Hmm, I reckon it will take one
or two days longer than that.

1085
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:23,005
One or two?

1086
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:23,939
Hopefully, yeah.

1087
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,008
So, you think we might have
five days without meals?

1088
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:27,209
Yeah.

1089
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:34,216
[Natalia] <i>We're, like, starving.</i>
<i>We're starving, starving.</i>

1090
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:37,186
It feels like we haven't eaten for ages.

1091
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:38,654
Forever.

1092
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,022
The last thing I had was M&Ms.

1093
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:44,727
Oh, no, I had a packet of M&Ms
and this morning a bag of nuts.

1094
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:46,896
[Natalia] Nuts, we had nuts a while ago.

1095
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:02,845
So, I've just come into the forecabin
after a sunset shift with Nat.

1096
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,414
<i>Something's gone wrong</i>
<i>with one of our batteries.</i>

1097
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:09,218
<i>They both drained completely</i>
<i>and ran really low on power,</i>

1098
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:13,255
<i>so, we had to switch everything off</i>
<i>and navigate just using our compass.</i>

1099
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:16,292
We haven't really got power to do
anything else, so, for the last few days

1100
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:21,797
we've been hand-pumping water using
our emergency backup water maker.

1101
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:26,869
<i>So, in our two-hour rest shifts,</i>
<i>we've been having to spend an hour of that</i>

1102
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:29,738
<i>sitting out in the heat and the sunshine</i>

1103
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:33,943
<i>pumping water,</i>
<i>which is actually surprisingly hard work.</i>

1104
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,044
<i>It's so painfully slow.</i>

1105
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,747
So, our electric water maker makes
30 liters of water an hour,

1106
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:42,051
and our hand pump makes
about three liters of water an hour,

1107
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:46,755
and that's if you don't rest or drink
or do anything while you're going, so...

1108
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:50,226
<i>Obviously, the longer that we're out here,</i>
<i>we're getting into cyclone season</i>

1109
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:51,727
<i>and that's not ideal.</i>

1110
01:18:51,794 --> 01:18:53,862
The winds are getting
less and less favorable.

1111
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,131
The risk of cyclones is getting higher.

1112
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:58,334
<i>We're definitely not as strong</i>
<i>as we used to be.</i>

1113
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:12,915
[Tony] <i>You can make landfall on a beach</i>
<i>to complete the record.</i>

1114
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:15,184
<i>Looks like it's our only choice.</i>

1115
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:18,454
How close are they?

1116
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:21,023
They're within two miles.

1117
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,858
They're about a mile and a half away.

1118
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,460
Mile and a half away.

1119
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:33,535
[Natalia] <i>We're about 20 miles away</i>
<i>from Cairns,</i>

1120
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:37,940
<i>and this should be one</i>
<i>of the best moments of the trip.</i>

1121
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:43,779
Yet, as always seems to happen,
we get thrown another challenge.

1122
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,286
<i>We're fighting wind now and current.</i>

1123
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:53,355
And it doesn't look likely
that we're going to make the marina

1124
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:55,557
where we're supposed to sort of arrive.

1125
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:58,193
Where we should have actually arrived
two days ago.

1126
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:01,330
So, we have one last option,

1127
01:20:01,397 --> 01:20:06,068
<i>which is to get to landfall,</i>
<i>so, it's not the marina, but it's land.</i>

1128
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:09,104
<i>And that will at least mean</i>
<i>it's a successful expedition.</i>

1129
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,209
<i>Due to adverse currents and lack of food,</i>

1130
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:17,346
<i>we have until sunrise tomorrow</i>

1131
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:19,882
to make that landfall.

1132
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:21,950
<i>Otherwise we may need to be rescued.</i>

1133
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:28,157
It's just... [sniffs]

1134
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,528
so near but yet so fricking far.

1135
01:20:33,529 --> 01:20:34,897
Like how...

1136
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:38,467
the project could just be...

1137
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:43,972
disqualified in the last 20 miles
because we can't reach land.

1138
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:52,147
[Natalia] <i>This is giving 110 percent</i>

1139
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:56,352

<i>if it's sustainable or not, to be honest.</i>

1140
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:05,627
<i>Over 8000 nautical miles</i>
<i>from America to Australia...</i>

1141
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:09,031
and all that matters is

1142
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:14,303
<i>the last 2.15 nautical miles.</i>

1143
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:17,072

1144
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,108

[Laura] <i>We're here.</i>

1146
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:37,259
I can see land out the window.
Like, that's Australia.

1147
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:43,899
And it's really bizarre to think
of everything that we've gone through

1148
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,335
for four years.

1149
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,437
Four years of relentless...

1150
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:52,441
not giving up, of persevering...

1151
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:57,146
of just believing in something
so strongly...

1152
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,615
<i>to make it happen, and it's here.</i>

1153
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:06,989
<i>For the expedition to be complete,</i>

1154
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:09,992
we needed to go from mainland America
to mainland Australia.

1155
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:14,696
And the thing is currents and wind
have not been in our favor lately.

1156
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:15,931
So...

1157
01:22:15,998 --> 01:22:19,034
instead of rowing into the marina,
which is taking us way too long,

1158
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:22,104
and we've just been
caught by the currents,

1159
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:26,041
we decided to bring her in
to a beach on the mainland,

1160
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:30,145
and then, very kindly, sort of a couple
of Australians that live here

1161
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:33,182
have offered then that they would tow us
round to the marina.

1162
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:41,557
<i>All that matters now is planting our feet</i>
<i>on the shore of Australia</i>

1163

1164
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,069
[Tony] <i>The girls landed on a beach</i>

1165
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:56,305
<i>so they could claim</i>
<i>the land-to-land unassisted record.</i>

1166
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:05,280
<i>They then had to get back on </i>Doris,

1167
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,149
<i>row back out,</i>
<i>and be towed into the marina,</i>

1168
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:09,685

1169

<i>one day someone is going to do this.</i>

1171
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:35,404
So, what's gonna make them
be able to do it over you guys?

1172
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,838
It's only the fact of digging deep

1173
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:40,208
and just keep getting back up
every time you get knocked down.

1174
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:44,413
I feel I could be a bit on edge and either
cry or laugh, not sure which way yet.

Nine months since we left San Francisco

under the Golden Gate Bridge,

1181

1184
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:21,416
